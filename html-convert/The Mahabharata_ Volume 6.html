<h2 class="eb04mainhead">Introduction</h2>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout"><span class="dropcaps">T</span>he Hindu tradition has an amazingly large corpus of religious texts, spanning Vedas, Vedanta (<em class="calibre4">brahmana</em>s,<a id="calibre_link-1360" href="#calibre_link-142" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">1</sup></a> <em class="calibre4">aranyaka</em>s,<a id="calibre_link-1361" href="#calibre_link-143" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">2</sup></a> Upanishads,), Vedangas,<a id="calibre_link-1362" href="#calibre_link-144" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">3</sup></a> <em class="calibre4">smriti</em>s, Puranas, dharmashastras and <em class="calibre4">itihasa</em>. For most of these texts, especially if one excludes classical Sanskrit literature, we don’t quite know when they were composed and by whom, not that one is looking for single authors. Some of the minor Puranas (Upa Purana) are of later vintage. For instance, the Bhavishya Purana (which is often listed as a major Purana or Maha Purana) mentions Queen Victoria.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented">In the listing of the corpus above figures itihasa, translated into English as history. History doesn’t entirely capture the nuance of itihasa, which is better translated as ‘this is indeed what happened’. Itihasa isn’t myth or fiction. It is a chronicle of what happened; it is fact. Or so runs the belief. And itihasa consists of India’s two major epics, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. The former is believed to have been composed as poetry and the latter as prose. This isn’t quite correct. The Ramayana has segments in prose and the Mahabharata has segments in poetry. Itihasa doesn’t quite belong to the category of religious texts in a way that the Vedas and Vedanta are religious. However, the dividing line between what is religious and what is not is fuzzy. After all, itihasa is also about attaining the objectives of <em class="calibre4">dharma</em>,<a id="calibre_link-1363" href="#calibre_link-145" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">4</sup></a> <em class="calibre4">artha</em>,<a id="calibre_link-1364" href="#calibre_link-146" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">5</sup></a> <em class="calibre4">kama</em><a id="calibre_link-1365" href="#calibre_link-147" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">6</sup></a> and <em class="calibre4">moksha</em><a id="calibre_link-1366" href="#calibre_link-148" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">7</sup></a> and the Mahabharata includes Hinduism’s most important spiritual text&mdash;the Bhagavad Gita.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented">The epics are not part of the <em class="calibre4">shruti</em> tradition. That tradition is like revelation, without any composer. The epics are part of the <em class="calibre4">smriti </em>tradition. At the time they were composed, there was no question of texts being written down. They were recited, heard, memorized and passed down through the generations. But the smriti tradition had composers. The Ramayana was composed by Valmiki, regarded as the first poet or <em class="calibre4">kavi</em>. The word kavi has a secondary meaning as poet or rhymer. The primary meaning of kavi is someone who is wise.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented">And in that sense, the composer of the Mahabharata was no less wise. This was Vedavyasa or Vyasadeva. He was so named because he classified (<em class="calibre4">vyasa</em>) the Vedas. Vedavyasa or Vyasadeva isn’t a proper name. It is a title. Once in a while, in accordance with the needs of the era, the Vedas need to be classified. Each such person obtains the title and there have been twenty-eight Vyasadevas so far.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented">At one level, the question about who composed the Mahabharata is pointless. According to popular belief and according to what the Mahabharata itself states, it was composed by Krishna Dvaipayana Vedavyasa (Vyasadeva). But the text was not composed and cast in stone at a single point in time. Multiple authors kept adding layers and embellishing it. Sections just kept getting added and it is no one’s suggestion that Krishna Dvaipayana Vedavyasa composed the text of the Mahabharata as it stands today.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented">Consequently, the Mahabharata is far more unstructured than the Ramayana. The major sections of the Ramayana are known as <em class="calibre4">kanda</em>s and one meaning of the word kanda is the stem or trunk of a tree, suggesting solidity. The major sections of the Mahabharata are known as <em class="calibre4">parva</em>s and while one meaning of the word parva is limb or member or joint, in its nuance there is greater fluidity in the word parva than in kanda.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented">The Vyasadeva we are concerned with had a proper name of Krishna Dvaipayana. He was born on an island (<em class="calibre4">dvipa</em>). That explains the Dvaipayana part of the name. He was dark. That explains the Krishna part of the name. (It wasn’t only the incarnation of Vishnu who had the name of Krishna.) Krishna Dvaipayana Vedavyasa was also related to the protagonists of the Mahabharata story. To go back to the origins, the Ramayana is about the solar dynasty, while the Mahabharata is about the lunar dynasty. As is to be expected, the lunar dynasty begins with Soma (the moon) and goes down through Pururava (who married the famous apsara Urvashi), Nahusha and Yayati. Yayati became old, but wasn’t ready to give up the pleasures of life. He asked his sons to temporarily loan him their youth. All but one refused. The ones who refused were cursed that they would never be kings, and this includes the Yadavas (descended from Yadu). The one who agreed was Puru and the lunar dynasty continued through him. Puru’s son Duhshanta was made famous by Kalidasa in the Duhshanta&ndash;Shakuntala story and their son was Bharata, contributing to the name of Bharatavarsha. Bharata’s grandson was Kuru. We often tend to think of the Kouravas as the evil protagonists in the Mahabharata story and the Pandavas as the good protagonists. Since Kuru was a common ancestor, the appellation Kourava applies equally to Yudhishthira and his brothers and Duryodhana and his brothers. Kuru’s grandson was Shantanu. Through Satyavati, Shantanu fathered Chitrangada and Vichitravirya. However, the sage Parashara had already fathered Krishna Dvaipayana through Satyavati. And Shantanu had already fathered Bhishma through Ganga. Dhritarasthra and Pandu were fathered on Vichitravirya’s wives by Krishna Dvaipayana.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented">The story of the epic is also about these antecedents and consequents. The core Mahabharata story is known to every Indian and is normally understood as a dispute between the Kouravas (descended from Dhritarashtra) and the Pandavas (descended from Pandu). However, this is a distilled version, which really begins with Shantanu. The non-distilled version takes us to the roots of the genealogical tree and at several points along this tree we confront a problem with impotence/sterility/death, resulting in offspring through a surrogate father. Such sons were accepted in that day and age. Nor was this a lunar dynasty problem alone. In the Ramayana, Dasharatha of the solar dynasty also had an infertility problem, corrected through a sacrifice. To return to the genealogical tree, the Pandavas won the Kurukshetra war. However, their five sons through Droupadi were killed. So was Bhima’s son Ghatotkacha, fathered on Hidimba. As was Arjuna’s son Abhimanyu, fathered on Subhadra. Abhimanyu’s son Parikshit inherited the throne in Hastinapura, but was killed by a serpent. Parikshit’s son was Janamejaya.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented">Krishna Dvaipayana Vedavyasa’s powers of composition were remarkable. Having classified the Vedas, he composed the Mahabharata in 100,000 shlokas or couplets. Today’s Mahabharata text doesn’t have that many shlokas, even if the Hari Vamsha (regarded as the epilogue to the Mahabharata) is included. One reaches around 90,000 shlokas. That too, is a gigantic number. (The Mahabharata is almost four times the size of the Ramayana and is longer than any other epic anywhere in the world.) For a count of 90,000 Sanskrit shlokas, we are talking about something in the neighbourhood of two million words. The text of the Mahabharata tells us that Krishna Dvaipayana finished this composition in three years. This doesn’t necessarily mean that he composed 90,000 shlokas. The text also tells us that there are three versions to the Mahabharata. The original version was called Jaya and had 8,800 shlokas. This was expanded to 24,000 shlokas and called Bharata. Finally, it was expanded to 90,000 (or 100,000) shlokas and called Mahabharata.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented">Krishna Dvaipayana didn’t rest even after that. He composed the eighteen Maha Puranas, adding another 400,000 shlokas. Having composed the Mahabharata, he taught it to his disciple Vaishampayana. When Parikshit was killed by a serpent, Janamejaya organized a snake-sacrifice to destroy the serpents. With all the sages assembled there, Vaishampayana turned up and the assembled sages wanted to know the story of the Mahabharata, as composed by Krishna Dvaipayana. Janamejaya also wanted to know why Parikshit had been killed by the serpent. That’s the background against which the epic is recited. However, there is another round of recounting too. Much later, the sages assembled for a sacrifice in Naimisharanya and asked Lomaharshana (alternatively, Romaharshana) to recite what he had heard at Janamejaya’s snake-sacrifice. Lomaharshana was a <em class="calibre4">suta</em>, the sutas being charioteers and bards or raconteurs. As the son of a suta, Lomaharshana is also referred to as Souti. But Souti or Lomaharshana aren’t quite his proper names. His proper name is Ugrashrava. Souti refers to his birth. He owes the name Lomaharshana to the fact that the body-hair (<em class="calibre4">loma</em> or <em class="calibre4">roma</em>) stood up (<em class="calibre4">harshana</em>) on hearing his tales. Within the text therefore, two people are telling the tale. Sometimes it is Vaishampayana and sometimes it is Lomaharshana. Incidentally, the stories of the Puranas are recounted by Lomaharshana, without Vaishampayana intruding. Having composed the Puranas, Krishna Dvaipayana taught them to his disciple Lomaharshana. For what it is worth, there are scholars who have used statistical tests to try and identify the multiple authors of the Mahabharata.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented">As we are certain there were multiple authors rather than a single one, the question of when the Mahabharata was composed is somewhat pointless. It wasn’t composed on a single date. It was composed over a span of more than 1000 years, perhaps between 800 <small class="calibre6">BCE</small> and 400 <small class="calibre6">ACE</small>. It is impossible to be more accurate than that. There is a difference between dating the composition and dating the incidents, such as the date of the Kurukshetra war. Dating the incidents is both subjective and controversial and irrelevant for the purposes of this translation. A timeline of 1000 years isn’t short. But even then, the size of the corpus is nothing short of amazing.</p>
<p class="bodytextcenterlinespace">∗ ∗ ∗</p>
<p class="eb01bodytextlinespace">Familiarity with Sanskrit is dying out. The first decades of the twenty-first century are quite unlike the first decades of the twentieth. Lamentation over what is inevitable serves no purpose. English is increasingly becoming the global language, courtesy colonies (North America, South Asia, East Asia, Australia, New Zealand, Africa) rather than the former colonizer. If familiarity with the corpus is not to die out, it needs to be accessible in English.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented">There are many different versions or recensions of the Mahabharata. However, between 1919 and 1966, the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute (BORI) in Pune produced what has come to be known as the critical edition. This is an authenticated text produced by a board of scholars and seeks to eliminate later interpolations, unifying the text across the various regional versions. This is the text followed in this translation. One should also mention that the critical edition’s text is not invariably smooth. Sometimes, the transition from one shloka to another is abrupt, because the intervening shloka has been weeded out. With the intervening shloka included, a non-critical version of the text sometimes makes better sense. On a few occasions, I have had the temerity to point this out in the notes which I have included in my translation. On a slightly different note, the quality of the text in something like Dana Dharma Parva is clearly inferior. It couldn’t have been ‘composed’ by the same person.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented">It took a long time for this critical edition to be put together. The exercise began in 1919. Without the Hari Vamsha, the complete critical edition became available in 1966. And with the Hari Vamsha, the complete critical edition became available in 1970. Before this, there were regional variations in the text and the main versions were available from Bengal, Bombay and the south. However, now, one should stick to the critical edition, though there are occasional instances where there are reasons for dissatisfaction with what the scholars of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute have accomplished. But in all fairness, there are two published versions of the critical edition. The first one has the bare bones of the critical edition’s text. The second has all the regional versions collated, with copious notes. The former is for the ordinary reader, assuming he/she knows Sanskrit. And the latter is for the scholar. Consequently, some popular beliefs no longer find a place in the critical edition’s text. For example, it is believed that Vedavyasa dictated the text to Ganesha, who wrote it down. But Ganesha had a condition before accepting. Vedavyasa would have to dictate continuously, without stopping. Vedavyasa threw in a counter-condition. Ganesha would have to understand each couplet before he wrote it down. To flummox Ganesha and give himself time to think, Vedavyasa threw in some cryptic verses. This attractive anecdote has been excised from the critical edition’s text. Barring material that is completely religious (specific hymns or the Bhagavad Gita), the Sanskrit text is reasonably easy to understand. Oddly, I have had the most difficulty with things that Vidura has sometimes said, other than parts of Anushasana Parva. Arya has today come to connote ethnicity. Originally, it meant language. That is, those who spoke Sanskrit were Aryas. Those who did not speak Sanskrit were mlecchas. Vidura is supposed to have been skilled in the mlechha language. Is that the reason why some of Vidura’s statements seem obscure? In similar vein, in popular renderings, when Droupadi is being disrobed, she prays to Krishna. Krishna provides the never-ending stream of garments that stump Duhshasana. The critical edition has excised the prayer to Krishna. The never-ending stream of garments is given as an extraordinary event. However, there is no intervention from Krishna.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented">How is the Mahabharata classified? The core component is the couplet or shloka. Several such shlokas form a chapter or <em class="calibre4">adhyaya</em>. Several adhyayas form a parva. Most people probably think that the Mahabharata has eighteen parvas. This is true, but there is another 100-parva classification that is indicated in the text itself. That is, the adhyayas can be classified either according to eighteen parvas or according to 100 parvas. The table (given on pp. xxiii&ndash;xxvi ), based on the critical edition, should make this clear. As the table shows, the present critical edition only has ninety-eight parvas of the 100-parva classification, though the 100 parvas are named in the text.</p>

<p class="eb03bodytextindented">Thus, interpreted in terms of BORI’s critical edition, the Mahabharata no longer possesses the 100,000 shlokas it is supposed to have. The figure is a little short of 75,000 (73,787 to be precise). Should the Hari Vamsha be included in a translation of the Mahabharata? It doesn’t quite belong. Yet, it is described as a <em class="calibre4">khila</em> or supplement to the Mahabharata and BORI includes it as part of the critical edition, though in a separate volume. In this case also, the translation of the Hari Vamsha will be published in a separate and independent volume. With the Hari Vamsha, the number of shlokas increases to a shade less than 80,000 (79,860 to be precise). However, in some of the regional versions the text of the Mahabharata proper is closer to 85,000 shlokas and with the Hari Vamsha included, one approaches 95,000, though one doesn’t quite touch 100,000.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented">Why should there be another translation of the Mahabharata? Surely, it must have been translated innumerable times. Contrary to popular impression, unabridged translations of the Mahabharata in English are extremely rare. One should not confuse abridged translations with unabridged versions. There are only five unabridged translations&mdash;by Kisori Mohan Ganguly (1883&ndash;96), by Manmatha Nath Dutt (1895&ndash;1905), by the University of Chicago and J.A.B. van Buitenen (1973 onwards), by P. Lal and Writers Workshop (2005 onwards) and the Clay Sanskrit Library edition (2005 onwards). Of these, P. Lal is more a poetic trans-creation than a translation. The Clay Sanskrit Library edition is not based on the critical edition, deliberately so. In the days of Ganguly and Dutt, the critical edition didn’t exist. The language in these two versions is now archaic and there are some shlokas that these two translators decided not to include, believing them to be untranslatable in that day and age. Almost three decades later, the Chicago version is still not complete, and the Clay edition, not being translated in sequence, is still in progress. However, the primary reason for venturing into yet another translation is not just the vacuum that exists, but also reason for dissatisfaction with other attempts. Stated more explicitly, this translation, I believe, is better and more authentic&mdash;but I leave it to the reader to be the final judge. (While translating 80,000 shlokas is a hazardous venture, since Ganguly and Dutt were Bengalis, and P. Lal was one for many purposes, though not by birth, surely a fourth Bengali must also be pre-eminently qualified to embark on this venture!)</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented">A few comments on the translation are now in order. First, there is the vexed question of diacritical marks&mdash;should they be used or not? Diacritical marks make the translation and pronunciation more accurate, but often put readers off. Sacrificing academic purity, there is thus a conscious decision to avoid diacritical marks. Second, since diacritical marks are not being used, Sanskrit words and proper names are written in what seems to be phonetically natural and the closest&mdash;such as, Droupadi rather than Draupadi. There are rare instances where avoidance of diacritical marks can cause minor confusion, for example, between Krishna (Krishnaa) as in Droupadi<a id="calibre_link-1367" href="#calibre_link-149" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">9</sup></a> and Krishna as in Vaasudeva. However, such instances are extremely rare and the context should make these differences, which are mostly of the gender kind, clear. Third, there are some words that simply cannot be translated. One such word is dharma. More accurately, such words are translated the first time they occur. But on subsequent occasions, they are romanized in the text. Fourth, the translation sticks to the Sanskrit text as closely as possible. If the text uses the word Kounteya, this translation will leave it as Kounteya or Kunti’s son and not attempt to replace it with Arjuna. Instead, there will be a note explaining that in that specific context Kounteya refers to Arjuna or, somewhat more rarely, Yudhishthira or Bhima. This is also the case in the structure of the English sentences. To cite an instance, if a metaphor occurs towards the beginning of the Sanskrit shloka, the English sentence attempts to retain it at the beginning too. Had this not been done, the English might have read smoother. But to the extent there is a trade-off, one has stuck to what is most accurate, rather than attempting to make the English smooth and less stilted.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented">As the table shows, the parvas (in the eighteen-parva classification) vary widely in length. The gigantic Aranyaka or Shanti Parva can be contrasted with the slim Mousala Parva. Breaking up the translation into separate volumes based on this eighteen-parva classification therefore doesn’t work. The volumes will not be remotely similar in size. Most translators seem to keep a target of ten to twelve volumes when translating all the parvas. Assuming ten volumes, 10 per cent means roughly 200 chapters and 7000 shlokas. This works rather well for Adi Parva, but collapses thereafter. Most translators therefore have Adi Parva as the first volume and then handle the heterogeneity across the eighteen parvas in subsequent volumes. This translation approaches the break-up of volumes somewhat differently, in the sense that roughly 10 per cent of the text is covered in each volume. The complete text, as explained earlier, is roughly 200 chapters and 7,000 shlokas per volume. For example, then, this first volume has been cut off at 199 chapters and a little less than 6,500 shlokas. It includes 90 per cent of Adi Parva, but not all of it and covers the first fifteen parvas of the 100-(or 98-) parva classification.</p>
<p class="bodytextcenterlinespace">∗ ∗ ∗</p>
<p class="eb01bodytextlinespace">The Mahabharata is one of the greatest stories ever told. It has plots and subplots and meanderings and digressions. It is much more than the core story of a war between the Kouravas and the Pandavas, which everyone is familiar with, the culmination of which was the battle in Kurukshetra. In the Adi Parva, there is a lot more which happens before the Kouravas and the Pandavas actually arrive on the scene. In the 100-parva classification, the Kouravas and the Pandavas don’t arrive on the scene until Section 6.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented">From the Vedas and Vedanta literature, we know that Janamejaya and Parikshit were historical persons. From Patanjali’s grammar and other contemporary texts, we know that the Mahabharata text existed by around 400 <small class="calibre6">BCE</small>. This need not of course be the final text of Mahabharata, but could have been the original text of Jaya. The Hindu eras or <em class="calibre4">yuga</em>s are four in number&mdash;Satya (or Krita) Yuga, Treta Yuga, Dvapara Yuga and Kali Yuga. This cycle then repeats itself, with another Satya Yuga following Kali Yuga. The events of the Ramayana occurred in Treta Yuga. The events of the Mahabharata occurred in Dvapara Yuga. This is in line with Rama being Vishnu’s seventh incarnation and Krishna being the eighth. (The ninth is Buddha and the tenth is Kalki.) We are now in Kali Yuga. Kali Yuga didn’t begin with the Kurukshetra war. It began with Krishna’s death, an event that occurred thirty-six years after the Kurukshetra war. Astronomical data do exist in the epic. These can be used to date the Kurukshetra war, or the advent of Kali Yuga. However, if the text was composed at different points in time, with additions and interpolations, internal consistency in astronomical data is unlikely. In popular belief, following two alternative astronomers, the Kurukshetra war has been dated to 3102 <small class="calibre6">BCE</small> (following Aryabhatta) and 2449 <small class="calibre6">BCE</small> (following Varahamihira). This doesn’t mesh with the timelines of Indian history. Mahapadma Nanda ascended the throne in 382 <small class="calibre6">BCE</small>, a historical fact on which there is no dispute. The Puranas have genealogical lists. Some of these state that 1050 years elapsed between Parikshit’s birth and Mahapadma Nanda’s ascension. Others state that 1015 years elapsed. (When numerals are written in words, it is easy to confuse 15 with 50.) This takes Parikshit’s birth and the Kurukshetra war to around 1400 <small class="calibre6">BCE</small>. This is probably the best we can do, since we also know that the Kuru kingdom flourished between 1200 <small class="calibre6">BCE</small> and 800 <small class="calibre6">BCE</small>. To keep the record straight, archaeological material has been used to bring forward the date of the Kurukshetra war to around 900 <small class="calibre6">BCE</small>, the period of the Iron Age.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented">As was mentioned, in popular belief, the incidents of the Ramayana took place before the incidents of the Mahabharata. The Ramayana story also figures in the Mahabharata. However, there is no reference to any significant Mahabharata detail in the Ramayana. Nevertheless, from reading the text, one gets the sense that the Mahabharata represents a more primitive society than the Ramayana. The fighting in the Ramayana is more genteel and civilized. You don’t have people hurling rocks and stones at each other, or fighting with trees and bare arms. Nor do people rip apart the enemy’s chest and drink blood. The geographical knowledge in the Mahabharata is also more limited than in the Ramayana, both towards the east and towards the south. In popular belief, the Kurukshetra war occurred as a result of a dispute over land and the kingdom. That is true, in so far as the present text is concerned. However, another fight over cattle took place in the Virata Parva and the Pandavas were victorious in that too. This is not the place to expand on the argument. But it is possible to construct a plausible hypothesis that this was the core dispute. Everything else was added as later embellishments. The property dispute was over cattle and not land. In human evolution, cattle represents a more primitive form of property than land. In that stage, humankind is still partly nomadic and not completely settled. If this hypothesis is true, the Mahabharata again represents an earlier period compared to the Ramayana. This leads to the following kind of proposition. In its final form, the Mahabharata was indeed composed after the Ramayana. But the earliest version of the Mahabharata was composed before the earliest version of the Ramayana. And the events of the Mahabharata occurred before the events of the Ramayana, despite popular belief. The proposition about the feud ending with Virata Parva illustrates the endless speculation that is possible with the Mahabharata material. Did Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva ever exist? Nakula and Sahadeva have limited roles to play in the story. Arjuna’s induction could have been an attempt to assert Indra’s supremacy. Arjuna represents such an integral strand in the story (and of the Bhagavad Gita), that such a suggestion is likely to be dismissed out of hand. But consider the following. Droupadi loved Arjuna a little bit more than the others. That’s the reason she was denied admission to heaven. Throughout the text, there are innumerable instances where Droupadi faces difficulties. Does she ever summon Arjuna for help on such occasions? No, she does not. She summons Bhima. Therefore, did Arjuna exist at all? Or were there simply two original Pandava brothers&mdash;one powerful and strong, and the other weak and useless in physical terms. Incidentally, the eighteen-parva classification is clearly something that was done much later. The 100-parva classification seems to be older.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented">The Mahabharata is much more real than the Ramayana. And, therefore, much more fascinating. Every conceivable human emotion figures in it, which is the reason why it is possible to identify with it even today. The text itself states that what is not found in the Mahabharata, will not be found anywhere else. Unlike the Ramayana, India is littered with real places that have identifications with the Mahabharata. (Ayodhya or Lanka or Chitrakuta are identifications that are less certain.) Kurukshetra, Hastinapura, Indraprastha, Karnal, Mathura, Dvaraka, Gurgaon, Girivraja are real places: the list is endless. In all kinds of unlikely places, one comes across temples erected by the Pandavas when they were exiled to the forest. In some of these places, archaeological excavations have substantiated the stories. The war for regional supremacy in the Ganga&ndash;Yamuna belt is also a plausible one. The Vrishnis and the Shurasenas (the Yadavas) are isolated, they have no clear alliance (before the Pandavas) with the powerful Kurus. There is the powerful Magadha kingdom under Jarasandha and Jarasandha had made life difficult for the Yadavas. He chased them away from Mathura to Dvaraka. Shishupala of the Chedi kingdom doesn’t like Krishna and the Yadavas either. Through Kunti, Krishna has a matrimonial alliance with the Pandavas. Through Subhadra, the Yadavas have another matrimonial alliance with the Pandavas. Through another matrimonial alliance, the Pandavas obtain Drupada of Panchala as an ally. In the course of the royal sacrifice, Shishupala and Jarasandha are eliminated. Finally, there is yet another matrimonial alliance with Virata of the Matsya kingdom, through Abhimanyu. When the two sides face each other on the field of battle, they are more than evenly matched. Other than the Yadavas, the Pandavas have Panchala, Kashi, Magadha, Matsya and Chedi on their side. The Kouravas have Pragjyotisha, Anga, Kekaya, Sindhu, Avanti, Gandhara, Shalva, Bahlika and Kamboja as allies. At the end of the war, all these kings are slain and the entire geographical expanse comes under the control of the Pandavas and the Yadavas. Only Kripacharya, Ashvatthama and Kritavarma survive on the Kourava side.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented">Reading the Mahabharata, one forms the impression that it is based on some real incidents. That does not mean that a war on the scale that is described took place. Or that miraculous weapons and chariots were the norm. But there is such a lot of trivia, unconnected with the main story, that their inclusion seems to serve no purpose unless they were true depictions. For instance, what does the physical description of Kripa’s sister and Drona’s wife, Kripi, have to do with the main story? It is also more real than the Ramayana because nothing, especially the treatment of human emotions and behaviour, exists in black and white. Everything is in shades of grey. The Uttara Kanda of the Ramayana is believed to have been a later interpolation. If one excludes the Uttara Kanda, we generally know what is good. We know who is good. We know what is bad. We know who is bad. This is never the case with the Mahabharata. However, a qualification is necessary. Most of us are aware of the Mahabharata story because we have read some version or the other, typically an abridged one. Every abridged version simplifies and condenses, distills out the core story. And in doing that, it tends to paint things in black and white, fitting everything into the mould of good and bad. The Kouravas are bad. The Pandavas are good. And good eventually triumphs. The unabridged Mahabharata is anything but that. It is much more nuanced. Duryodhana isn’t invariably bad. He is referred to as Suyodhana as well, and not just by his father. History is always written from the point of view of the victors. While the Mahabharata is generally laudatory towards the Pandavas, there are several places where the text has a pro-Kourava stance. There are several places where the text has an anti-Krishna stance. That’s yet another reason why one should read an unabridged version, so as not to miss out on these nuances. Take the simple point about inheritance of the kingdom. Dhritarashtra was blind. Consequently, the king was Pandu. On Pandu’s death, who should inherit the kingdom? Yudhishthira was the eldest among the brothers. (Actually, Karna was, though it didn’t become known until later.) We thus tend to assume that the kingdom was Yudhishthira’s by right, because he was the eldest. (The division of the kingdom into two, Hastinapura and Indraprastha, is a separate matter.) But such primogeniture was not universally clear. A case can also be established for Duryodhana, because he was Dhritarashtra’s son. If primogeniture was the rule, the eldest son of the Pandavas was Ghatotkacha, not Abhimanyu. Before both were killed, Ghatotkacha should have had a claim to the throne. However, there is no such suggestion anywhere. The argument that Ghatotkacha was the son of a rakshasa or demon will not wash. He never exhibited any demonic qualities and was a dutiful and loving son. Karna saved up a weapon for Arjuna and this was eventually used to kill Ghatotkacha. At that time, we have the unseemly sight of Krishna dancing around in glee at Ghatotkacha being killed.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented">In the Mahabharata, because it is nuanced, we never quite know what is good and what is bad, who is good and who is bad. Yes, there are degrees along a continuum. But there are no watertight and neat compartments. The four objectives of human existence are dharma, artha, kama and moksha. Etymologically, dharma is that which upholds. If one goes by the Bhagavad Gita, pursuit of these four are also transient diversions. Because the fundamental objective is to transcend these four, even moksha. Within these four, the Mahabharata is about a conflict of dharma. Dharma has been reduced to <em class="calibre4">varnashrama</em> dharma, according to the four classes (<em class="calibre4">varna</em>s) and four stages of life (<em class="calibre4">ashrama</em>s). However, these are collective interpretations of dharma, in the sense that a Kshatriya in the<em class="calibre4"> garhasthya</em> (householder) stage has certain duties. Dharma in the Mahabharata is individual too. Given an identical situation, a Kshatriya in the garhasthya stage might adopt a course of action that is different from that adopted by another Kshatriya in the garhasthya stage, and who is to judge what is wrong and what is right? Bhishma adopted a life of celibacy. So did Arjuna, for a limited period. In that stage of celibacy, both were approached by women who had fallen in love with them. And if those desires were not satisfied, the respective women would face difficulties, even death. Bhishma spurned the advance, but Arjuna accepted it. The conflict over dharma is not only the law versus morality conflict made famous by Krishna and Arjuna in the Bhagavad Gita. It pervades the Mahabharata, in terms of a conflict over two different notions of dharma. Having collectively married Droupadi, the Pandavas have agreed that when one of them is closeted with Droupadi, the other four will not intrude. And if there is such an instance of intrusion, they will go into self-exile. Along comes a Brahmana whose cattle have been stolen by thieves. Arjuna’s weapons are in the room where Droupadi and Yudhishthira are. Which is the higher dharma? Providing succour to the Brahmana or adhering to the oath? Throughout the Mahabharata, we have such conflicts, with no clear normative indications of what is wrong and what is right, because there are indeed no absolute answers. Depending on one’s decisions, one faces the consequences and this brings in the unsolvable riddle of the tension between free will and determinism, the so-called karma concept. The boundaries of philosophy and religion blur.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented">These conflicts over dharma are easy to identify with. It is easy to empathize with the protagonists, because we face such conflicts every day. That is precisely the reason why the Mahabharata is read even today. And the reason one says every conceivable human emotion figures in the story. Everyone familiar with the Mahabharata has thought about the decisions taken and about the characters. Why was life so unfair to Karna? Why was Krishna partial to the Pandavas? Why didn’t he prevent the war? Why was Abhimanyu killed so unfairly? Why did the spirited and dark Droupadi, so unlike the Sita of the Ramayana, have to be humiliated publicly?</p>
<p class="bodytextcenterlinespace">∗ ∗ ∗</p>
<p class="eb01bodytextlinespace">It is impossible to pinpoint when and how my interest in the Mahabharata started. As a mere toddler, my maternal grandmother used to tell me stories from <em class="calibre4">Chandi</em>, part of the Markandeya Purana. I still vividly recollect pictures from her copy of <em class="calibre4">Chandi</em>: Kali licking the demon Raktavija’s blood. Much later, in my early teens, at school in Ramakrishna Mission, Narendrapur, I first read the Bhagavad Gita, without understanding much of what I read. The alliteration and poetry in the first chapter was attractive enough for me to learn it by heart. Perhaps the seeds were sown there. In my late teens, I stumbled upon Bankimchandra Chattopadhyay’s <em class="calibre4">Krishna Charitra</em>, written in 1886. Bankimchandra was not only a famous novelist, he was a brilliant essayist. For a long time, <em class="calibre4">Krishna Charitra</em> was not available other than in Bengali. It has now been translated into English, but deserves better dissemination. A little later, when in college, I encountered Buddhadeb Bose’s <em class="calibre4">Mahabharater Katha</em>. That was another brilliant collection of essays, first serialized in a magazine and then published as a book in 1974. This too was originally in Bengali, but is now available in English. Unlike my sons, my first exposure to the Mahabharata story came not through television serials but comic books. Upendrakishore Raychowdhury’s Mahabharata (and Ramayana) for children was staple diet, later supplanted by Rajshekhar Basu’s abridged versions of both epics, written for adults. Both were in Bengali. In English, there was Chakravarti Rajagopalachari’s abridged translation, still a perennial favourite. Later, Chakravarthi Narasimhan’s selective unabridged translation gave a flavour of what the Mahabharata actually contained. In Bengal, the Kashiram Das version of the Mahabharata, written in the seventeenth century, was quite popular. I never found this appealing. But in the late 1970s, I stumbled upon a treasure. Kolkata’s famous College Street was a storehouse of old and second-hand books in those days. You never knew what you would discover when browsing. In the nineteenth century, an unabridged translation of the Mahabharata had been done in Bengali under the editorship of Kaliprasanna Singha (1840&ndash;70). I picked this up for the princely sum of Rs 5. The year may have been 1979, but Rs 5 was still amazing. This was my first complete reading of the unabridged version of the Mahabharata. This particular copy probably had antiquarian value. The pages would crumble in my hands and I soon replaced my treasured possession with a republished reprint. Not longer after, I acquired the Aryashastra version of the Mahabharata, with both the Sanskrit and the Bengali together. In the early 1980s, I was also exposed to three Marathi writers writing on the Mahabharata. There was Iravati Karve’s <em class="calibre4">Yuganta</em>. This was available in both English and in Marathi. I read the English one first, followed by the Marathi. The English version isn’t an exact translation of the Marathi and the Marathi version is far superior. Then there was Durga Bhagwat’s <em class="calibre4">Vyas Parva</em>. This was in Marathi and I am not aware of an English translation. Finally, there was Shivaji Sawant’s <em class="calibre4">Mritunjaya</em>, a kind of autobiography for Karna. This was available both in English and in Marathi. Incidentally, one should mention John Smith’s excellent abridged translation, based on the Critical Edition, and published while this unabridged translation was going on.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented">In the early 1980s, quite by chance, I encountered two shlokas, one from Valmiki’s Ramayana, the other from Kalidasa’s <em class="calibre4">Meghadutam</em>. These were two poets separated by anything between 500 to 1,000 years, the exact period being an uncertain one. The shloka in <em class="calibre4">Meghadutam</em> is right towards the beginning, the second shloka to be precise. It is the first day in the month of Ashada. The yaksha has been cursed and has been separated from his beloved. The mountains are covered with clouds. These clouds are like elephants, bent down as if in play. The shloka in the Valmiki Ramayana occurs in Sundara Kanda. Rama now knows that Sita is in Lanka. But the monsoon stands in the way of the invasion. The clouds are streaked with flags of lightning and garlanded with geese. They are like mountain peaks and are thundering, like elephants fighting. At that time, I did not know that elephants were a standard metaphor for clouds in Sanskrit literature. I found it amazing that two different poets separated by time had thought of elephants. And because the yaksha was pining for his beloved, the elephants were playing. But because Rama was impatient to fight, the elephants were fighting. I resolved that I must read all this in the original. It was a resolution I have never regretted. I think that anyone who has not read <em class="calibre4">Meghadutam</em> in Sanskrit has missed out on a thing of beauty that will continue to be a joy for generations to come.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented">In the early 1980s, Professor Ashok Rudra was a professor of economics in Visva-Bharati, Santiniketan. I used to teach in Presidency College, Kolkata, and we sometimes met. Professor Rudra was a left-wing economist and didn’t think much of my economics. I dare say the feeling was reciprocated. By tacit agreement, we never discussed economics. Instead, we discussed Indological subjects. At that point, Professor Rudra used to write essays on such subjects in Bengali. I casually remarked, ‘I want to do a statistical test on the frequency with which the five Pandavas used various weapons in the Kurukshetra war.’ Most sensible men would have dismissed the thought as crazy. But Professor Rudra wasn’t sensible by usual norms of behaviour and he was also a trained statistician. He encouraged me to do the paper, written and published in Bengali, using the Aryashastra edition. Several similar papers followed, written in Bengali. In 1983, I moved to Pune, to the Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics, a stone’s throw away from BORI. <em class="calibre4">Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute (ABORI)</em> is one of the most respected journals in Indology. Professor G.B. Palsule was then the editor of ABORI and later went on to become Director of BORI. I translated one of the Bengali essays into English and went and met Professor Palsule, hoping to get it published in ABORI. To Professor Palsule’s eternal credit, he didn’t throw the dilettante out. Instead, he said he would get the paper refereed. The referee’s substantive criticism was that the paper should have been based on the critical edition, which is how I came to know about it. Eventually, this paper (and a few more) were published in ABORI. In 1989, these became a book titled <em class="calibre4">Essays on the Ramayana and the Mahabharata</em>, published when the Mahabharata frenzy had reached a peak on television. The book got excellent reviews, but hardly sold. It is now out of print. As an aside, the book was jointly dedicated to Professor Rudra and Professor Palsule, a famous economist and a famous Indologist respectively. Both were flattered. However, when I gave him a copy, Professor Rudra said, ‘Thank you very much. But who is Professor Palsule?’ And Professor Palsule remarked, ‘Thank you very much. But who is Professor Rudra?’</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented">While the research interest in the Mahabharata remained, I got sidetracked into translating. Through the 1990s, there were abridged translations of the Maha Puranas, the Vedas and the eleven major Upanishads. I found that I enjoyed translating from the Sanskrit to English and since these volumes were well received, perhaps I did do a good job. With Penguin as publisher, I did a translation of the Bhagavad Gita, something I had always wanted to do. <em class="calibre4">Sarama and Her Children</em>, a book on attitudes towards dogs in India, also with Penguin, followed. I kept thinking about doing an unabridged translation of the Mahabharata and waited to muster up the courage. That courage now exists, though the task is daunting. With something like two million words and ten volumes expected, the exercise seems open-ended. But why translate the Mahabharata? In 1924, George Mallory, with his fellow climber Andrew Irvine, may or may not have climbed Mount Everest. They were last seen a few hundred metres from the summit, before they died. Mallory was once asked why he wanted to climb Everest and he answered, ‘Because it’s there.’ Taken out of context, there is no better reason for wanting to translate the Mahabharata. There is a steep mountain to climb. And I would not have dared had I not been able to stand on the shoulders of the three intellectual giants who have preceded me&mdash;Kisori Mohan Ganguli, Manmatha Nath Dutt and J.A.B. van Buitenen.</p>

And because Yudhishthira was protected, Drona’s pledge was not fulfilled. All the warriors on your side had their armour splintered and were regarded as having been vanquished.

Having obtained the permission of Bharadvaja’s son,<a id="calibre_link-2295" href="#calibre_link-783" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">4</sup></a> they retreated. They were distressed on account of the enemy, which was successful in its objective. They were severely humiliated in that battle.

The words had affection and petulance in them, since the evil-minded one was overcome by the prosperity of the enemy. In everyone’s hearing, the one who was eloquent spoke these angry words. ‘O supreme among brahmanas! There is no doubt that you have singled us out as those who should be killed. Therefore, despite having approached Yudhishthira, you did not seize him. If you so wish, an enemy that you glance towards in battle is incapable of escaping, even if the Pandavas, together with the immortals, desire to protect him. You were pleased and granted me a boon.

Those who are noble<a id="calibre_link-2298" href="#calibre_link-786" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">7</sup></a> never act so as to destroy the hopes of those who are devoted to them.’ Having been addressed in this unpleasant way, Bharadvaja’s son spoke to the king. ‘Knowing that I always seek to do what brings you pleasure, you should not regard me in this way.

He has obtained strength and knowledge about <a id="calibre_link-2557" class="calibre2"></a>fighting from different places.’ After Drona had spoken in this way, the masses of samshaptakas again challenged Arjuna to a battle in the southern direction. The battle that took place between Arjuna and the enemy was one the like of which had not been seen before, nor heard of ever. O king! And Drona created a resplendent vyuha that was incapable of being looked at. It was like the sun when it reaches midday in its course and scorches down on everything. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! On the instruction of his father’s eldest brother, Abhimanyu penetrated the impenetrable chakra vyuha in many different ways. He performed an extremely difficult deed and killed many thousands of brave ones. Then, six heroes attacked him together and he was finally slain by Duhshasana’s son. All of us were supremely delighted and the Pandavas were oppressed by grief. O king! After Subhadra’s son had been killed, our troops retreated.”</p>

On hearing that he has been slain in battle, my mind is severely shattered. The dharma of kshatriyas, as laid down by those who have set the principles of dharma, is terrible. Desiring a kingdom, brave ones shower down their weapons on a child. He was a child and was reared in happiness. But he roamed around fearlessly. O Gavalgana’s son!<a id="calibre_link-2304" href="#calibre_link-792" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">13</sup></a> Tell me how many, skilled in the use of weapons, slew him. O Sanjaya!

In knowledge of the sacred texts, gravity, sweetness, spirit, prowess and valour, the brave Sahadeva is the equal of the gods who are the Ashvins. All the great qualities in Krishna and all the qualities in the Pandavas, all those assembled qualities were to be seen in Abhimanyu.

The strength of Drona’s arms was seen to be extraordinary, in that the Panchalas, together with the Srinjayas, could not advance before him. On seeing that Drona was advancing wrathfully, Yudhishthira thought about many ways whereby Drona could be countered. Having formed the view that Drona was incapable of being resisted by anyone else, Yudhishthira imposed that heavy and unbearable burden on Subhadra’s son. He was not inferior to Vasudeva.

You should advance to the fight only after you have thought over whether you have the capacity to bear this. Drona, the preceptor, is skilled in the use of supreme weapons and has conquered exhaustion. You have been reared in extreme happiness and are not skilled in fighting.’ On hearing these words, Abhimanyu laughed and spoke to his charioteer. ‘O charioteer! Who is Drona?

While that fearful battle raged, in Drona’s sight, Arjuna’s son shattered and penetrated the vyuha. The immensely strong one penetrated into the midst of the enemy and began to slaughter the foes.

Covered with blood, they were strewn around on the ground and looked radiant. O venerable one! It was as if five-headed serpents had been slain by Garuda. There were many heads with beautiful noses, faces and hair, without the marks of wounds and adorned with beautiful earrings. Copious quantities of blood flowed from these and the teeth gnashed the lips in anger. They were adorned with beautiful garlands and headdresses, embellished with gems and jewels. They were like lotuses severed from the stalks and possessed the radiance of the sun or the moon. Once upon a time, they could speak many beneficial and pleasant words and were smeared with sacred fragrances. Phalguna’s son covered the earth with the heads of the enemy. There were many excellent chariots, with forms like the cities of the gandharvas. They possessed shafts in the front and curved staffs made out of bamboo poles. Their shafts, yokes and wheels were shattered. They were bereft of their axles and pins. They lost their wheels, standards and seats. The implements of war were scattered. The expensive cushions were also scattered and thousands of riders slain. Everything that could be seen was mangled with his arrows. He used sharp arrows, honed at the tip, to slice down the enemy riders on elephants, with their flags, goads and pennants, quivers, armour, seats, reins and blankets, the bells on the trunks and the tusks, and also those who guarded their steps from the rear. There were horses from Vanayu, Kamboja, Bahlika and the mountainous regions. They were well trained and swift and could keep their tails, ears and eyes immobile. The warriors who rode on them were accomplished and wielded spears, swords and lances. They were strewn around, deprived of cushions and whisks. Their tongues lolled out. The eyes were detached and the entrails and livers were plucked out. Their harnesses were torn and their riders were killed. This delighted large numbers of flesh-eaters. The mail and armour was sliced away and they were covered in urine and excrement. Thus bringing down the best of your horses, he was resplendent. He accomplished these difficult deeds alone, like the unfathomable Vishnu in earlier times. He crushed your giant army with the three kinds of forces.<a id="calibre_link-2330" href="#calibre_link-818" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">39</sup></a> O descendant of the <a id="calibre_link-2583" class="calibre2"></a>Bharata lineage! He also killed your foot soldiers. Using sharp arrows, Subhadra’s son was seen to single-handedly destroy your soldiers, like Skanda<a id="calibre_link-2331" href="#calibre_link-819" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">40</sup></a> against the asura army. Those on your side and your sons glanced in the ten directions. Their mouths were dry. Their eyes were restless. They were covered with sweat and their body hair stood up. They lost all interest in vanquishing the enemy and made up their minds to flee. Wishing to remain alive, they cried and called out to each other by name and lineage. They abandoned wounded sons, fathers, well-wishers, relatives and kin. They urged their horses and elephants, so that they could run away quickly.”’</p>

On seeing that the king had returned and was advancing in the battle against Subhadra’s son, Drona spoke to all the warriors. ‘Protect the king. While we look on, the valiant Abhimanyu is killing everything that he is targeting. Do not be afraid.

They confounded him and freed Duryodhana. But Arjuna’s son could not tolerate that something he <a id="calibre_link-2586" class="calibre2"></a>had grasped should be taken away. With a great shower of arrows, he enveloped the horses and the charioteers of those maharathas. Having repulsed them, Subhadra’s son roared like a lion. On hearing his roar, which was like that of a lion in search of flesh, the rathas, with Drona at the forefront, were extremely enraged. They could not tolerate it. O venerable one! They encircled him from all sides with a mass of chariots. They released a mass of many different kinds of arrows at him. But your grandson used sharp arrows to sever them in the sky and then pierced them back in turn. It was extraordinary. They were enraged by those arrows, which were like the virulent poison of snakes. Wishing to kill him, they surrounded Subhadra’s son, who refused to run away. That ocean of your soldiers was like a sea. But Abhimanyu held it back, like the shoreline against the abode of <em class="calibre4">makara</em>s.<a id="calibre_link-2336" href="#calibre_link-824" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">45</sup></a> Those brave ones fought, wishing to kill each other. There was Abhimanyu on one side and the enemy on the other and no one wished to retreat. A terrible and fearful combat raged.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2587">‘“Duhsaha pierced Abhimanyu with nine arrows, Duhshasana with twelve, Sharadvata Kripa with three and Drona with seventeen arrows, each of which was like a venomous serpent. Vivimshati pierced him with twenty, Kritavarma with seven, Brihadbala with eight, Ashvatthama with seven, Bhurishrava with three arrows and the king of Madra with six arrows. Shakuni pierced him with two arrows and King Duryodhana with three. In turn, he pierced each of them back with three arrows. O great king! With the bow in his hand, the powerful Abhimanyu seemed to dance around. He was enraged because he was oppressed by your sons. He exhibited the great strength he had acquired through learning and practice. He was borne on well-trained horses, with speeds like those of Garuda or the wind. They bore him swiftly and he countered the heir of Ashmaka.<a id="calibre_link-2337" href="#calibre_link-825" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">46</sup></a> Asking him to wait, Abhimanyu used ten arrows to <a id="calibre_link-2588" class="calibre2"></a>cut down his charioteer, his horses, his standard, his arms, his bow and his head. Having brought these down, he smiled. When the brave lord of Ashmaka was thus slain by Subhadra’s son, all his soldiers wavered and began to run away. Karna, Kripa, Drona, Drona’s son, the king of Gandhara, Shala, Shalya, Bhurishrava, Kratha, Somadatta, Vivimshati, Vrishasena, Sushena, Kundabhedi, Pratardana, Vrindaraka, Lalittha, Prabahu, Dirghalochana and the enraged Duryodhana showered down arrows on him. Those great archers pierced him with their arrows and Abhimanyu became angry. He shot arrows at Karna that were capable of penetrating the body. O king! They pierced his armour and his body and penetrated the earth, like a snake entering a termite hill. Having been thus wounded by him, Karna was pained and swooned. In that battle, he was like a mountain trembling because of an earthquake. With three other sharp arrows, the angry and powerful one slew Sushena, Dirghalochana and Kundabhedi. Having recovered, Karna pierced him with twenty-five iron arrows, Ashvatthama with twenty and Kritavarma with seven. With arrows piercing all his limbs, the son of Shakra’s son<a id="calibre_link-2338" href="#calibre_link-826" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">47</sup></a> was seen to angrily roam around amidst the soldiers, like Yama with a noose in his hand. Shalya was near him and he repulsed him with a shower of arrows. The mighty-armed one roared and terrified your soldiers. O king! Pierced in his inner organs by the one who was skilled in the use of weapons, Shalya lost his senses and sat down on the floor of his chariot. While Bharadvaja’s son looked on, on seeing that he had been thus pierced by Subhadra’s illustrious son, all the soldiers began to run away. They saw that the mighty-armed one<a id="calibre_link-2339" href="#calibre_link-827" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">48</sup></a> was covered with gold-tufted arrows. Those on your side began to flee, like deer oppressed by a lion.

Listen to how that young one sported around in that great battle, when he shattered the array of chariots protected by Bharadvaja’s son. On seeing that the lord of Madra was crushed in that battle by the arrows of Subhadra’s son, Shalya’s younger brother angrily advanced and covered him with a shower of arrows. He pierced Arjuna’s son, his horses and his charioteer, with ten arrows and roared loudly, asking him<a id="calibre_link-2343" href="#calibre_link-831" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">52</sup></a> to wait. However, Arjuna’s son severed his head from his neck, his arms, his feet, his bow, his horses, his umbrella, his standard, his charioteer, the three poles on the chariot, his seat, his wheels, his yoke, his quiver, the floor of the chariot, his bows, his flag, those who protected his wheels and all his other implements. He was so swift in piercing them that no one could see him. That infinitely energetic one lost his life and fell down on the ground, pierced through his ornaments and garments, like a giant tree<a id="calibre_link-2344" href="#calibre_link-832" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">53</sup></a> shattered by the wind. His followers were terrified and fled in all the directions. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! On witnessing the deeds of Arjuna’s son, all the beings roared in applause in every direction. After Shalya’s brother had been killed, many of his soldiers advanced against Arjuna’s son, loudly proclaiming their lineages, their residences and their names. They angrily attacked him, with many different kinds of weapons in their hands. Intoxicated in <a id="calibre_link-2593" class="calibre2"></a>their strength, they were on chariots, horses and elephants. There were others on foot. The great sound of arrows mingled with the sounds of hooves. There were roars and loud exclamations, sounds like that of roaring lions. Some slapped their palms and twanged their bowstrings, trying to scare Arjuna’s son. They said, ‘As long as we are alive, you will not escape with your life today.’ On hearing and seeing them, Subhadra’s son laughed. Having smiled, he used arrows to pierce those who had struck him first. He exhibited many wonderful weapons and his dexterity. In that encounter, Arjuna’s brave son fought gently with them.<a id="calibre_link-2345" href="#calibre_link-833" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">54</sup></a> He had obtained weapons from Vasudeva and Dhananjaya.

No gap could be seen between his taking up and shooting an arrow. The blazing circle of his outstretched bow could be seen in all the directions, like the flaming circle of the sun destroying all darkness. The twanging of his bowstring and the terrible slapping of his palms could be heard. It was like the roaring of the clouds when a great thunderclap is disgorged. Though he was intolerant, Subhadra’s son was modest. The handsome one showed due reverence. Showing respect to the heroes, he fought with arrows and other weapons. O great king! He started gently and became fierce later, like the illustrious sun during the autumn, after the monsoon is over. His great shower of arrows was colourful. The arrows were gold-tufted and sharpened on stone. He angrily released hundreds of them, like the rays of the sun in the sky.

He exhibited his energy in all the directions. On witnessing the conduct of Subhadra’s infinitely energetic son, your soldiers trembled repeatedly. Bharadvaja’s powerful and immensely wise son dilated his eyes in delight. O venerable one!

But because of affection and delusion, he does not wish to slay Arjuna’s son. In a battle, no assailant can escape from him, even if it were to be Death himself, not to speak of other mortals. I tell you this truthfully. He is protecting Arjuna’s son, as if he is his own student. Sons, students and the sons of students are always loved by those who follow dharma. Protected by Drona, he thinks himself to be brave. Though he is proud of himself, he is stupid. Let us swiftly crush him.’ Thus addressed by the king, while Bharadvaja’s son looked on, they rushed against Satvati’s son.<a id="calibre_link-2353" href="#calibre_link-841" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">62</sup></a> They were angry and wished to kill him.

Intoxicated with victory,<a id="calibre_link-2358" href="#calibre_link-846" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">67</sup></a> you addressed many maddening words towards Bhima.

O <a id="calibre_link-2603" class="calibre2"></a>evil-minded one! You will reap the fruits of terrible adharma. While all these soldiers look on, I will chastise you with my arrows today. Today, in the battle, I will free myself of the debt of anger I bear towards you. Krishna is intolerant towards you and this is what my fathers also desire. O Kouravya! In the battle, I will free myself of the debt I owe to Bhima. If you do not give up the battle, you will not escape with your life.’ Having spoken these words, the mighty armed one, the destroyer of enemy heroes, released an arrow towards Duhshasana. It was like death, like the fire at the time of destruction and like the wind in its energy. It swiftly approached and pierced him in his shoulder joint. He again pierced him with another twenty-five. O great king! Thus severely pierced and wounded, Duhshasana sat down on the floor of his chariot. He was overcome by a great swoon. His charioteer quickly carried away the unconscious Duhshasana, who was oppressed by the arrows of Subhadra’s son, from the midst of that battle. On witnessing this, the Pandavas, Droupadi’s sons, Virata, the Panchalas and the Kekayas roared like lions. The soldiers of the sons of Pandu were delighted and in all directions, played on many different kinds of musical instruments. On witnessing the feat accomplished by Subhadra’s son, they laughed.</p>

Wishing to ensure the welfare of your son, he covered the unassailable Abhimanyu with sharp arrows. In the field of battle, he pierced his followers with sharp and supreme arrows and was contemptuous of Subhadra’s brave son. O king! Abhimanyu swiftly pierced Radheya with seventy-three arrows that possessed iron heads. The great-minded one wished to confront Drona. In that battle, there was no one who could repulse his advance towards Drona.

The powerful one was Rama’s<a id="calibre_link-2362" href="#calibre_link-850" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">71</sup></a> disciple and was supreme among those who possessed knowledge of weapons. In that battle, he oppressed Abhimanyu, whom enemies found invincible. He was afflicted by Radheya’s shower of weapons. But in that battle, Subhadra’s son did not waver. He was like an immortal. Arjuna’s son used sharp, broad-headed and straight-tufted arrows that had been sharpened on stone to sever the bows of the heroes and afflicted Karna. His standard and bow were severed and fell down on the ground. On seeing that Karna was confronting a hardship, Karna’s younger brother stretched his firm bow and quickly advanced against Subhadra’s son. The Parthas, and those who followed them, roared loudly. Satisfied with Subhadra’s son, they played on musical instruments.”’</p>

The immensely illustrious Abhimanyu angrily routed them with his arrows. Karna was afflicted by Abhimanyu’s many arrows. He fled on swift horses and the array was shattered. O king! Abhimanyu’s arrows covered the sky, like locusts or like a shower, and nothing could be seen. The warriors on your side were slaughtered by those sharp arrows. O king!

He used his sharp arrows to mangle the chariots, elephants, horses and men. The earth became impassable, because it was strewn with large numbers of headless torsos.

They were decorated in golden ornaments. They held bows and arrows. There were bodies and heads with earrings and garlands. There were thousands of these on the ground. It was impenetrable because of the decorations, seats, long poles, shattered axles and yokes, fragmented wheels and many chariots. There were javelins, swords and other weapons. Giant standards fell down. O lord of the earth! Kshatriyas, horses and elephants were slain. The earth became impassable and soon assumed an extremely terrible form. The princes were slain and lamented loudly. A great sound arose and it increased the fear of cowards. O best of the Bharata lineage! That sound filled all the directions. Subhadra’s son attacked the soldiers and killed the horses, rathas and elephants. He roamed in all the directions and nothing could be seen because of the dust that arose. Since they were enveloped in dust, we could not see the soldiers then. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! He killed the elephants, horses and men. We saw him the next instant, like the midday sun. O great king! Abhimanyu scorched the masses of the enemy. The son of Vasava’s son was like Vasava in the battle. O great king! Abhimanyu roamed around in the midst of the soldiers.”’</p>

I wish that I may alone be able to counter them in battle.’ O descendant of the Bharata lineage! This is what he asked for. Thus addressed, the lord of the gods spoke to Jayadratha in these words. ‘O amiable one! I will grant you the boon, but with the exception of Partha Dhananjaya. In a battle, you will be able to withstand the other four sons of Pandu.’ The king agreed to these words of the lord of the gods and awoke from his sleep. It is because of the boon that he obtained as a gift and because of the strength of his divine weapons, that he was able to repulse the army of the Pandavas single-handed. The twang of his bowstring and the slap of his palms overwhelmed the enemy kshatriyas with fear and also caused supreme delight among your soldiers. O king!

I will tell you everything, in detail, about how he fought with the sons of Pandu. Listen. There were well-trained horses from the Sindhu region, controlled by the charioteer. They were large and as fleet as the wind. These bore him. His chariot, constructed in the appropriate way, was like a city of the gandharvas. It was radiant with a standard that bore the mark of a large and silver-coloured boar. There was a white umbrella and pennants, with fans and whisks. These were the marks of a king. And he was as resplendent as the lord of the stars<a id="calibre_link-2374" href="#calibre_link-862" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">83</sup></a> in the firmament. The bumper on his chariot was made out of iron and <a id="calibre_link-2619" class="calibre2"></a>was decorated with pearls, diamonds, gems and gold. It was as dazzling as luminous bodies in the sky. He extended his great bow and released many arrows, filling up those parts that Arjuna’s son shattered.<a id="calibre_link-2375" href="#calibre_link-863" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">84</sup></a> He pierced Satyaki with three arrows and Vrikodara with eight, Dhrishtadyumna with sixty and Virata with ten arrows, Drupada with five sharp arrows and Shikhandi with ten, the Kekayas with twenty-five and Droupadi’s sons with three arrows each. He pierced Yudhishthira with seventy and mangled all others with a great net of arrows. It was extraordinary.</p>

On realizing his dexterity, Bhima again used three broad-headed arrows and severed his bow, standard and umbrella, so that they were swiftly brought down on the ground. O venerable one! The powerful one strung another bow and brought down Bhima’s standard, bow and horses. With his horses slain and his bow severed, he descended from his chariot and climbed onto Satyaki’s chariot, like a lion jumping onto the summit of a mountain. On witnessing this honourable and supreme deed on the part of the king of Sindhu, those on your side were delighted and shouted repeatedly in appreciation. All the beings honoured this deed, whereby he countered the enraged Pandavas alone, through the energy of his weapons. Subhadra’s son had created a route earlier, by slaughtering many warriors and elephants. But Saindhava restrained the armoured Pandus from that path. The brave Matsyas, Panchalas and Kekayas made every endeavour. So did the Pandavas. But they could not withstand Saindhava. Everyone who tried to penetrate Drona’s array was checked by Saindhava, as a consequence of the boon that he had obtained from the god.”’</p>

There commenced an extremely terrible battle between those on your side and the enemy.

The foremost among them, supreme among the Kurus, advanced duly against Subhadra’s son, the scorcher of enemies who was causing the agitation with his shower of arrows. That clash between him and them was extremely terrible and the infinitely energetic ones created showers of arrows. Arjuna’s son was obstructed in every direction by chariots of the enemy and killed Vrishasena’s charioteer and severed his bow. The powerful one then pierced his horses with arrows and those horses, which were as swift as the wind, bore his<a id="calibre_link-2378" href="#calibre_link-866" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">87</sup></a> chariot away from the field of battle.

He<a id="calibre_link-2379" href="#calibre_link-867" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">88</sup></a> was like a lion and enraged, mangling the enemy with his arrows. Without any fear, Vasatiya swiftly advanced and attacked him. He restrained Abhimanyu with sixty gold-tufted arrows and said, ‘As long as I am alive, you will not escape from this battle with your life.’ He was clad in iron armour. But Subhadra’s son used a swift arrow to pierce him in the heart. Losing his life, he fell down on the ground. On seeing that Vasatiya had been killed, the bulls among the kshatriyas were enraged. O king! They surrounded your grandson, wishing to kill him. They stretched their many different kinds of bows in many different kinds of ways. A terrible battle raged between Subhadra’s son and the enemy. Phalguna’s son was wrathful. He sliced down their arrows and bows and the heads from the bodies, decorated with earrings and garlands. Severed arms were seen, decorated with golden ornaments. They held swords and finger guards, lances and battleaxes. Garlands, ornaments, garments and <a id="calibre_link-2624" class="calibre2"></a>giant standards fell down. There were armour and shields, necklaces, crowns, umbrellas and whisks. It became impassable because of decorations, seats and poles. There were shattered and fragmented axles, wheels and yokes in thousands. There were <em class="calibre4">anukarsha</em>s.<a id="calibre_link-2380" href="#calibre_link-868" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">89</sup></a> And flags, charioteers, horses, broken chariots and slain elephants, strewn all over the ground. Many brave kshatriyas, the lords of many countries, who had surrounded him with a desire for victory, were killed. They were strewn on the ground and it looked terrible. The angry Abhimanyu was in the field of battle, roaming in all the directions and sub-directions, and his form could not be seen. His golden armour and ornaments could alone be seen and also his bow and arrows. No one was capable of glancing at him with his eyes. He killed the warriors with his arrows and was stationed like the sun in their midst.”’</p>

That killer of the best of kshatriyas was like Death when he penetrated. He descended on Satyashrava, like a tiger descending on deer. When Satyashrava had been thus attacked, the other maharathas quickly grasped a large number of different weapons and rushed against Abhimanyu. ‘I will be the first. I will station myself in the forefront.’ Those bulls among kshatriyas rivalled each other and spoke thus. They attacked Arjuna’s son together, wishing to kill him. On seeing that army of kshatriyas advance against him, he received them, like a whale grasping small <a id="calibre_link-2627" class="calibre2"></a>fish in the ocean. Like rivers do not return once they head towards the ocean, not a single one who approached wished to run away. That army was like a boat in the ocean, when it has been grasped by a mighty storm and is tossed around by the force of the wind. It was oppressed by fear, trembled and was destroyed.</p>

He had desired to capture alive, or destroy, Subhadra’s illustrious son. O king! On seeing him killed, the friends of Shalya’s son, armed princes who were unassailable in battle and had standards decorated in gold, surrounded Arjuna’s son from every direction. The maharathas stretched bows that were as long as palm trees and showered down arrows on him. Subhadra’s unvanquished son was brave and alone. In that battle, he was surrounded by these brave ones, who were skilled, powerful, youthful and extremely intolerant. They enveloped him with their storm of arrows.

He was severely pierced and wounded and became as angry as a goaded <a id="calibre_link-2629" class="calibre2"></a>elephant. He affixed the gandharva weapon and its powers of maya.

He was like a circle of fire in that battle, exhibiting the swiftness of his weapons. The scorcher of enemies confounded them with the skill with which his chariot was driven and with the maya of his weapons. O king! He pierced the bodies of the kings in a hundred places. O king! In that battle, his sharp arrows took out the breath of life away from living bodies and they attained the other world, their bodies falling down on the ground. Phalguna’s son used his sharp and broad-headed arrows to sever their bows, horses, charioteers, standards, arms decorated with bracelets and heads. They were like five-year-old mango trees that were destroyed, though they were ready for yielding fruit. One hundred princes were killed by Subhadra’s son.

Arjuna’s son crushed that army of elephants, like a wind courses in every direction in the sky and drives away hundreds of clouds. Kratha’s son enveloped Arjuna’s son with a storm of arrows. In addition, other rathas, with Drona at the forefront, also returned. They attacked Subhadra’s son, using supreme and other weapons. Arjuna’s son repulsed them with his arrows and swiftly afflicted Kratha’s son with a continuous flood of arrows, wishing to kill him.

Otherwise, he will kill all of us single-handed.’ Vrisha Vaikartana Karna then spoke to <a id="calibre_link-2644" class="calibre2"></a>Drona.<a id="calibre_link-2402" href="#calibre_link-890" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">111</sup></a> ‘Before he destroys all of us, tell us how we can swiftly kill him.’ Drona, the great archer, told all of them, ‘Have you been able to detect any weakness in this young one? He is roaming around in all the directions. You had better search out your forefathers now. Behold this son of Pandava. He is quick and is a lion among men. The path followed by his chariot and the circle of his bow can be seen. He affixes and releases arrows extremely swiftly. His arrows confound me and afflict my breath of life. But I am delighted with Subhadra’s son, the destroyer of enemy heroes. When Subhadra’s son roams around on the field of battle, I am extremely gratified. The angry maharathas cannot detect a weakness in him. He is dexterous in the use of his hands and releases great arrows in all the directions. In the battle, I do not see any difference between him and the wielder of Gandiva.<a id="calibre_link-2403" href="#calibre_link-891" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">112</sup></a> At this, oppressed by the arrows of Arjuna’s son, Karna again spoke to Drona. ‘I am oppressed by the extremely terrible and energetic arrows of the young Abhimanyu. Nevertheless, I remain stationed here. His arrows are terrible and possess the energy of the fire. They are sapping my heart now.’ The preceptor smiled and spoke gently to Karna. ‘His armour is impenetrable. He is young, swift and valiant. His father has been instructed by me on the art of donning armour. It is certain that this destroyer of enemy cities knows everything about that.<a id="calibre_link-2404" href="#calibre_link-892" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">113</sup></a> But with well-aimed arrows, you are capable of slicing down his bow, his bowstring, the reins of his horses and the two charioteers who guard his flanks.<a id="calibre_link-2405" href="#calibre_link-893" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">114</sup></a> O great archer! O Radheya! If you are capable, do this. Make him retreat and strike him subsequently. If he wields the bow, the gods and the asuras are incapable of vanquishing him. If you so wish, deprive him of his chariot and his bow.’ Having heard the preceptor’s words, Vaikartana Karna used his arrows to swiftly slice down the bow of the light-handed one. Bhoja<a id="calibre_link-2406" href="#calibre_link-894" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">115</sup></a> killed his horses and Goutama<a id="calibre_link-2407" href="#calibre_link-895" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">116</sup></a> the <a id="calibre_link-2645" class="calibre2"></a>charioteers who guarded his flanks.

His bow had been severed and he was without a chariot. However, he was engaged in following his own dharma. The handsome one grasped a sword and a shield and leapt up into the sky. Arjuna’s son displayed his dexterity and strength and roamed around in the sky, like a terrible king of the birds.

Radheya used sharp arrows to cut down his supreme shield. Deprived of his sword and shield, but still whole in his limbs, he again descended from the sky onto the ground. He picked up a chariot wheel and angrily rushed at Drona. His limbs blazed because of the dust raised by the wheels. He was radiant, with the chariot wheel raised high in his arms. In that battle, for a short while, Abhimanyu looked beautiful and seemed to replicate the deeds of Vasudeva.<a id="calibre_link-2410" href="#calibre_link-898" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">119</sup></a> Blood flowed from his body.

The tips of his hair waved around in the wind. His supreme weapons were upraised. The lords of the earth looked at his body, though even the gods found it difficult to glance at it. They were extremely anxious because of the chariot wheel he held and sliced it down into many fragments. Krishna’s maharatha son then grasped a gigantic club. His enemies had deprived him of his bow and chariot, his sword and the chariot wheel. But with the club in his hand, Abhimanyu rushed against Ashvatthama. The upraised club was like a blazing thunderbolt. On beholding it, that bull among men<a id="calibre_link-2414" href="#calibre_link-902" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">123</sup></a> alighted from his chariot and took three steps backwards.

At this, Duhshasana’s son was enraged and raised his club. Asking Subhadra’s son to wait, he attacked him. Those two brave brothers wished to kill each other and raised their clubs against each other. They struck, like the destroyer Tryambaka<a id="calibre_link-2417" href="#calibre_link-905" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">126</sup></a> in earlier times. Having struck each other with the ends of their clubs, they both fell down on the ground. In the midst of that battle, those two scorchers of enemies were like Indra’s standards that had been uprooted. The ratha who was Duhshasana’s son, the extender of the deeds of the Kuru lineage, arose first and struck Subhadra’s son on the head with the club, as he was about to get up. Because of exhaustion and because of the great force of the club, Subhadra’s son, the destroyer of enemy heroes, lost his senses and fell down on the ground, unconscious.</p>

The brave one was as resplendent as a wild elephant killed by hunters. The brave one fell down and was surrounded by all those on your side. He looked like a fire during the summer, pacified by the onset of winter, or like a storm that has subsided after destroying the tops of trees. After scorching the army of the Bharatas, he was like a sun that has set, like the eclipsed moon, or the ocean with all its water dried up. His face was like the full moon. His eyelashes were as dark as the wings of crows. On seeing him lying down on the ground, all the maharathas on your side were supremely delighted. They roared repeatedly, like lions. O lord of the earth! Those on your side were overcome with great delight. But tears flowed down from the eyes of those on the other side. O lord of the earth! On seeing the brave one fallen down, like the moon dislodged from the firmament, beings were heard to speak in the firmament. ‘With Drona and Karna at the forefront, this single one has been slain by six maharathas from the side of the sons of Dhritarashtra. It is our view that this is not dharma.’ When that brave one was killed, the earth looked extremely beautiful, like the full moon in the sky, with a garland of <em class="calibre4">nakshatra</em>s.<a id="calibre_link-2418" href="#calibre_link-906" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">127</sup></a> It was strewn with gold-tufted arrows and covered with blood.

Strewn with these, it looked extremely beautiful. There were dead and dying horses and their riders, covered with blood. They had been brought down by Subhadra’s son and the earth was impassable. There were goads and the drivers of elephants, with armour, weapons and standards. The elephants had been mangled and pierced by arrows and looked like mountains. The earth was covered with these and <a id="calibre_link-2653" class="calibre2"></a>horses, without their charioteers and warriors. Crushed by slain elephants, the best of chariots looked like lakes. There were large numbers of slain infantry, adorned with weapons and ornaments. The earth assumed a terrible form and generated terror among cowards. He was as resplendent as the sun and the moon. On seeing him fallen down on the ground, those on your side were supremely delighted. The Pandus were distressed. O king! Abhimanyu was still a child and had not yet attained youth. But he was killed.</p>

Do not be frightened and remain here. We will yet vanquish the enemy in battle.’ In distress, the extremely energetic and extremely radiant one spoke these words. Dharmaraja was the foremost among warriors and spoke thus, to alleviate their misery. ‘He killed many enemy princes in this battle, those who were like venomous serpents. It was only after killing them in battle first that Arjuna’s son gave up his life.

There were masses of chariots and horses, with their slain riders, killed together and separately. Vessels and ornaments were strewn around. Tongues lolled out. Teeth jutted out. Entrails and eyes bulged out. The earth seemed to be extremely terrible. There were men with expensive armour and ornaments and the best of weapons. They were destroyed, together with their elephants, horses and chariots. Though they always deserved expensive beds and covers, they were slain and lay down helpless on the ground. Dogs, jackals, crows, wild crows, birds,<a id="calibre_link-2423" href="#calibre_link-911" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">132</sup></a> wolves, hyenas, ravens, others who feed on blood, masses of rakshasas and large numbers of <em class="calibre4">pishacha</em>s<a id="calibre_link-2424" href="#calibre_link-912" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">133</sup></a> were extremely delighted in that terrible field of battle.

It was extremely fearful, like Vaitarani,<a id="calibre_link-2425" href="#calibre_link-913" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">134</sup></a> and was difficult to traverse. The currents were blood that flowed from the bodies. The chariots were like rafts and the elephants were like rocks. The heads of men were the stones and the flesh was the mud. It flowed along, carrying many weapons like garlands. That terrible river flowed in the midst of that field of battle, bearing those from the world of the living to the world of the dead. Large numbers of <a id="calibre_link-2657" class="calibre2"></a>pishachas, horrible to look at, roared in terrible tones as they drank and ate there. They roared loudly, causing terror among those who were still alive. Dogs, jackals and birds also fed there. As night set in, the warriors glanced at that terrible sight, which was like the kingdom of the lord of the ancestors.<a id="calibre_link-2426" href="#calibre_link-914" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">135</sup></a> The men glanced at that which arose with its terrible banks, and then slowly walked away.

They seated themselves around King Yudhishthira. Their minds were on Subhadra’s deceased son and they reflected in misery. Since the maharatha Abhimanyu, his brother’s brave son, had been killed, King Yudhishthira was extremely overcome by grief and lamented. ‘To ensure that which would bring me pleasure, he penetrated Drona’s array. He shattered and penetrated the vyuha, like a lion in the midst of cattle. Brave and great archers from the other side encountered him in battle.

Addicted to my pleasure and desiring victory, I have performed this unpleasant deed for Subhadra, Keshava and Arjuna. An avaricious person does not understand his sins. Greed follows from delusion. Those who desire honey do not see the fall that confronts them and I am like that. He should have been honoured with food, vehicles, beds and ornaments. He was only a child. But we placed him at the forefront of the warriors. He was a child. He was young. He was not skilled in battle. What good could come from placing him in danger? He sacrificed himself like a well-trained horse. We will also lie down on the bare ground today, when we are scorched by Bibhatsu’s blazing anger and the misery of his eyes. He is not greedy. He is intelligent. He is modest. He is forgiving. He is handsome. He is powerful. He possesses a beautiful body. He is brave. He is affectionate. He is devoted to the truth. Even the gods praise his terrible deeds. The valiant one slaughtered the <em class="calibre4">nivatakavacha</em>s and the <em class="calibre4">kalakeya</em>s, the ones who were the enemies of the great Indra and resided in Hiranyapura.

Bibhatsu, the destroyer of enemy heroes, noticed that the camp was in a state of disarray. He told Krishna with a disturbed heart, ‘O Janardana!

I hope all the warriors, together with the king of Panchala and Virata, are fine. Today, with his brothers, Subhadra’s son has not emerged to greet me happily, with a smile on his face, now that I have returned from the battle.’ Having conversed in this way, the two of them entered their own camp.

I do not see Abhimanyu. Nor has he come forward to greet me. I heard that Drona constructed a chakra vyuha today. With the exception of Subhadra’s son, not a single one amongst you knew how to penetrate it in the battle. However, I did not teach him about emerging from the array. Did you ask the child to penetrate that enemy array? Did Subhadra’s son, the great archer and destroyer of enemy heroes, penetrate that array and fight with many among the enemy? Has he been slain and brought down? His eyes were red. He was mighty-armed. He was born<a id="calibre_link-2435" href="#calibre_link-923" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">144</sup></a> and was like a mountain lion.

Which warrior could have killed him? He was always loved by Subhadra, Droupadi and Keshava. If I do not see my son, I will go to Yama’s abode. The tips of his hair <a id="calibre_link-2667" class="calibre2"></a>were delicate and curled. He was a child. His eyes were like that of a young deer. He was as valiant as a crazy elephant. He was as tall as a young <em class="calibre4">shala</em> tree. He smiled when he spoke. He was self-controlled. He was always obedient to the words of his seniors. Even though he was a child, his deeds were like those of one who wasn’t a child. His words were pleasant and free of malice. He was great in his endeavour. He was mighty-armed. His eyes were long, like the petals of lotuses. He was compassionate towards those who were devoted to him. He was self-controlled. He did not follow that which was inferior. He was grateful. He possessed learning. He was skilled in the use of weapons. He did not retreat. He always rejoiced in battle and increased terror among the enemies. He was engaged in bringing pleasure to those on his own side. He desired the victory of his fathers. He never struck first in an encounter, violating codes of honour. If I do not see that son, I will go to Yama’s abode. He possessed a beautiful forehead. The tips of his hair were excellent. His eyebrows, eyes, teeth and lips were beautiful. Without seeing that face, how can there be peace in my heart? His words were pleasant and cheerful, like the melody of a male cuckoo. Without hearing those words, how can there be peace in my heart? His beauty was unmatched and is extremely rare, even among the residents of heaven. Without seeing that brave one, how can there be peace in my heart? He was skilled in showing honour. He was devoted to the words of his fathers. Without seeing him today, how can there be peace in my heart? He was delicate. He was always brave. He deserved the most expensive of beds. That supreme one among those who have protectors is lying down on the bare ground, as if he has no protector. Earlier, when he lay down, the best of women tended to him. With his limbs pierced and drained out, he is lying down today, tended to by inauspicious jackals. Earlier, he was awoken from his slumbers by the chants of bards, minstrels and raconteurs. It is certain that he will be awoken today by the distorted tones of beasts of prey. His beautiful face deserved to be covered by the shades of an umbrella. It is certain that it will be soiled today by the dust that has arisen from the field of battle. Alas, my son! I have never been satisfied from looking at my son. I am unfortunate. Death has forcibly taken him away from <a id="calibre_link-2668" class="calibre2"></a>me. Yama’s abode has always been attained by those with virtuous deeds. It is certain that you have rendered that beautiful region even more beautiful because of your own radiance today. It is certain that you are the beloved guest of Vaivasvata, Varuna, Shatakratu and the lord of riches and that your valour has obtained honour from them.’<a id="calibre_link-2438" href="#calibre_link-926" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">147</sup></a> He lamented thus, in many different ways, like a merchant whose ship has been sunk.</p>

Did that bull among men ascend to heaven after having fought well in the battle? Did he kill many bulls among men who fought against him? He was without an aide. There is no doubt that he thought of me when he sought help. When oppressed by arrows, my young son must have sought help from me. I think he must have lamented in this way when he was cruelly slain by the many. But he was my son and that of Madhava’s sister. He was born from Subhadra. Perhaps he could not have spoken in this way. It is certain that my heart is extremely firm and is made out of the essence of the vajra. Despite not being able to see the red-eyed and long-armed one, it is not shattered. How could those cruel and great archers shoot arrows at a child that penetrated the inner organs? He was Vasudeva’s sister’s son and my son. How could they shoot arrows at him? With an unblemished soul, he always used to greet me when I returned. I have returned after killing the enemy. Why don’t I see him today? It is certain that he has fallen down and is lying on the ground, covered in blood. He has made the earth beautiful with his body, like a sun that has fallen down. On hearing that he has been slain in battle, Subhadra will be miserable and will destroy herself. When she does not see Abhimanyu, what will she tell me? Overcome by grief, what will Droupadi tell me? What will I tell them? There is no doubt that my heart is made out of the essence of the vajra. On seeing my daughter-in-law weep, oppressed by sorrow, it is not shattering into a thousand fragments. I have heard the delighted sons of Dhritarashtra <a id="calibre_link-2670" class="calibre2"></a>roar like lions. Krishna heard Yuyutsu censure those brave ones in the following words. “O maharathas! Unable to withstand Bibhatsu, you have killed a child. O ones who are against dharma! Why are you rejoicing? You will now witness Partha’s prowess. In the battle, you have done what is disagreeable to Keshava and Arjuna. The time for sorrow has arrived, yet you are delightedly roaring like lions. The time will swiftly arrive for you to reap the fruits of this evil deed. You have performed extremely terrible adharma. How can you not reap the fruits soon?” Rebuking them in this way, the extremely intelligent son of the vaishya<a id="calibre_link-2439" href="#calibre_link-927" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">148</sup></a> cast his weapons away and departed, overcome by grief and anger. O Krishna! Why did you not tell me about this while the battle was going on? I would then have slaughtered all those cruel maharathas.’ Vasudeva consoled the one who was overcome with grief on account of his son.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2671">‘“He was full of terrible misery and Krishna spoke to him in these words. ‘Do not grieve. This is the path followed by all the brave ones who do not retreat, and in particular kshatriyas, whose livelihood comes from war. This is the path for brave ones who fight and do not retreat. This has been sanctioned by the sacred texts and is the supreme goal for those who follow the objective. For brave ones who do not retreat, death is certain in battle. There is no doubt that Abhimanyu has gone to the worlds meant for those with meritorious deeds. O bull among the Bharata lineage! This is desired by all the brave ones. O one who shows honour! They wish to obtain death, without retreating from battle. The brave one killed many immensely strong princes in the battle. Without retreating from battle, he obtained the death desired by valiant ones. O tiger among men! Do not sorrow. Earlier, those who have laid down the eternal codes of dharma have decreed that death in battle is the dharma for kshatriyas. O supreme among the Bharata lineage! All your brothers are distressed at seeing you immersed in grief, and so are these kings and well-wishers. O one who shows honour! <a id="calibre_link-2672" class="calibre2"></a>Comfort them with words of assurance. This should be known and all this is known to you. You should not grieve.’ Having been thus consoled by Krishna, the performer of extraordinary deeds, Partha spoke these words to all his brothers. His voice choked, Partha said, ‘O lord of the earth!<a id="calibre_link-2440" href="#calibre_link-928" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">149</sup></a> His arms were long. His eyes were as long as the petals of lotuses. I wish to hear the account of how Abhimanyu fought. You will see me slay my son’s enemies in the battle, with their elephants, chariots and horses, with their followers and kin. All of you are skilled in weapons and you held weapons in your hands. How could Subhadra’s son then have been slain, even if he had encountered the wielder of the vajra himself? Had I known that the Pandus and the Panchalas were incapable of protecting my son in battle, I would have protected him myself. All of you were stationed on your chariots and were shooting arrows. How could the enemy repulse you and kill Abhimanyu? You have no manliness. Nor do you possess any valour. While you looked on, Abhimanyu has been brought down in the battle. Perhaps I should censure myself, since I know that all of you are extremely weak. I went away, knowing that you are useless and cowards. Alas! Your armour, weapons and arms are only ornaments on your hands. Your words are only meant for assemblies. You could not protect my son.’ Having spoken these words, he sat down, with the supreme bow and sword in his hands. No one was capable of looking at Bibhatsu then. He sighed repeatedly in anger and looked like the Destroyer himself. He was overcome with grief on account of his son and his face was bathed in tears. With the exception of Vasudeva and the eldest son of Pandu, no one amongst the well-wishers was capable of glancing at him, or speaking to him. Those two were always acceptable to Arjuna and he listened to them. They were extremely revered and dearly loved and could speak to him at such times. On account of his son, his mind was distressed and he was full of sorrow. The king spoke these words to the enraged one, whose eyes were like the petals of lotuses.”’</p>

<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-2674">Chapter 1028(51)</h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-2675">‘“Yudhishthira said, ‘O mighty-armed one! When you left to fight with the army of the samshaptakas, the preceptor made efforts to capture me. But in every way, we succeeded in countering Drona’s battle formation. In the battle, we made efforts to arrange our army of chariots in a counter-formation. He was checked by the rathas and I was protected. Wishing to kill us swiftly, he oppressed us with sharp arrows. Thus afflicted by Drona, we were incapable of glancing at Drona’s array and could not even think of penetrating it. All of us then spoke to Subhadra’s son, who was your equal in valour. “O son! O lord! Penetrate the array.” Thus urged by us, the valiant one was like a well-trained horse. He took that burden on himself, ignoring how difficult it was to bear. He was valiant and he was instructed by you in the use of weapons. Though a child, the powerful one penetrated, like Suparna entering the ocean. In that battle, we followed Satvati’s brave son.<a id="calibre_link-2441" href="#calibre_link-929" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">150</sup></a> We wished to penetrate the army through the path that he had followed. O son!<a id="calibre_link-2442" href="#calibre_link-930" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">151</sup></a> But because of a boon that he had obtained from Rudra, the vile Saindhava, King Jayadratha, repulsed all of us. Then Drona, Kripa, Karna, Drona’s son, Brihadbala and Kritavarma&mdash;these six rathas surrounded Subhadra’s son. All those warrior maharathas surrounded the child. Though he strove to his utmost, they were many and he was deprived of his chariot. When he had been deprived of his chariot, Duhshasana’s son struck swiftly, though he had himself confronted great danger earlier. It was destiny that he<a id="calibre_link-2443" href="#calibre_link-931" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">152</sup></a> met his end. He slaughtered many thousands of the enemy earlier, elephants, horses, charioteers and riders, one hundred of the foremost among princes and many other unnamed and brave ones. He dispatched King Brihadbala to the world of heaven. Thus, through destiny, the supreme among those with dharma in their souls, attained his end. <a id="calibre_link-2676" class="calibre2"></a>Everything that extends our grief took place in this way. Thus it was that the tiger among men attained the world of heaven.’</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2677">‘Sanjaya said, “Arjuna heard the words that Dharmaraja had spoken. Lamenting, ‘Alas, son!’ he sighed in grief and fell down on the ground in his sorrow. With distressed faces, everyone surrounded Dhananjaya. They were overcome with misery and glanced at each other, without blinking their eyes. When he had recovered consciousness, Vasava’s son became unconscious with rage. He seemed to tremble, as if in a fever, and sighed repeatedly. He squeezed one hand with another and sighed, eyes bathed in tears. His glances were like one who was mad. He spoke these words. ‘Know this to be the truth. I will kill Jayadratha tomorrow. I will slay him, unless out of fear, he abandons the sons of Dhritarashtra, or seeks refuge with us, or seeks sanctuary with Purushottama Krishna, or with you. O great king! I will kill Jayadratha tomorrow. Engaged in doing what is pleasant to the sons of Dhritarashtra, he has forgotten his friendship with me. The evil one has been the reason behind the death of the child. I will kill Jayadratha tomorrow. Wishing to protect him, whoever fights with me, even if it is the brave Drona or Kripa, will be covered by me with arrows. O bulls among men! O brave and revered ones! If I do not achieve this in the battle, let me not attain the worlds meant for those with meritorious deeds. There are worlds meant for those who kill their mothers and those who kill their fathers, for those who have intercourse with the wives of their teachers and for those who are wicked, for those who hate virtuous ones and speak ill of others, for those who misappropriate wealth left in their custody and for those who violate trust and for those who speak ill of women they have enjoyed earlier. There are worlds for those who kill brahmanas and those who kill cattle. There are worlds for those who eat <em class="calibre4">payasa</em>,<a id="calibre_link-2444" href="#calibre_link-932" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">153</sup></a> food made of barley, herbs, dishes made of sesamum, cakes and meat without offering them to the gods first. If I do not kill Jayadratha, let those worlds be mine. There are worlds for those who disrespect the best of brahmanas who are devoted to studying the Vedas, others who deserve honour, <a id="calibre_link-2678" class="calibre2"></a>the aged, the virtuous and seniors. There are worlds attained by those who touch brahmanas, cattle and fire with their feet and those who release phlegm, excreta and urine in water. If I do not kill Jayadratha, let those terrible ends be mine. There are ends obtained by those who bathe naked and those who do not serve guests. There are ends obtained by those who take bribes, those who are liars and those who are deceitful, those who harm their own souls and those who speak false praises. There are ends obtained by wretches who eat sweetmeats in the sight of servants, sons, wives and dependents, without offering them a share. If I do not kill Jayadratha, let those terrible ends be mine. There are ends obtained by those who abandon virtuous and obedient dependents and those evil-souled ones who censure those who have done them good deeds. There are ends for those who do not give deserving neighbours shares in <em class="calibre4">shraddha</em><a id="calibre_link-2445" href="#calibre_link-933" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">154</sup></a> offerings, for those who give to the undeserving, for those who have alliances with women of low caste,<a id="calibre_link-2446" href="#calibre_link-934" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">155</sup></a> for those who are drunkards, for those who disrespect those who deserve honour, those who are ungrateful and those who speak ill of their brothers. If I do not kill Jayadratha, let those ends swiftly be mine. I have recounted the ends of those who do not follow dharma and there are others that I have not enumerated. If tomorrow’s night passes without my having killed Jayadratha, let those ends swiftly become mine. Listen to another pledge that I am taking. If tomorrow’s sun sets without my having killed the wretched one, I will enter the blazing fire at this spot. O asuras! O gods! O men! O birds! O serpents! O ancestors! O those who wander in the night! O brahmanas! O mobile and immobile objects! O everyone else! You will be incapable of protecting my enemy. Even if he descends to the fierce nether regions, even if he goes to the city of the gods or the city of the daityas, I will strike him with a hundred arrows in the morning. I will slice off the head of my son’s foe.’ Having spoken thus, he stretched Gandiva with his left hand and his right. The sound of his touching the bow transcended his own words. When Arjuna took the pledge, Janardana blew on <a id="calibre_link-2679" class="calibre2"></a>Panchajanya.<a id="calibre_link-2447" href="#calibre_link-935" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">156</sup></a> Enraged, Dhananjaya blew on Devadatta.<a id="calibre_link-2448" href="#calibre_link-936" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">157</sup></a> Filled completely with the wind from Achyuta’s mouth, Panchajanya made a loud sound. The sound released from it made the lords of the universe, the nether regions and the directions tremble, like that at the destruction of a yuga. When the great-souled one had taken the oath, the sons of Pandu roared like lions. Musical instruments were sounded in every direction.”’</p>

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-2688">‘Sanjaya said, “The spies heard the loud noise the Pandus created on account of their son and reported it. Jayadratha arose. His heart was senseless with grief and he was oppressed by great misery. It seemed as if he was immersed in a giant and fathomless ocean of sorrow. Having thought a lot, Saindhava went to the assembly of <a id="calibre_link-2689" class="calibre2"></a>kings and lamented in front of all those kings. He was frightened of Abhimanyu’s father and was ashamed. He spoke these words. ‘He was born in Pandu’s field when Shakra was full of desire.<a id="calibre_link-1182" href="#calibre_link-1271" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">1</sup></a> That evil-minded one wishes to send me to Yama’s eternal abode. May all of you be fortunate. In an attempt to remain alive, I will now go back to my own house. O bulls among kshatriyas! Alternatively, resort to your strength to save me. Partha wishes to send me to the end meant for heroes. Grant me safety from that. Drona, Duryodhana, Kripa, Karna, the lord of Madra, Bahlika, Duhshasana and the others are capable of saving a person who is afflicted by Yama, not to speak of Phalguna alone desiring to injure my limbs. Why should all you assembled lords of the earth not be able to save me? Having heard the delighted sounds of the Pandaveyas, my fear is great. O lords of the earth! My limbs are overcome by lassitude, like one who is about to die. There is no doubt that the wielder of Gandiva has sworn my death. That is the reason the Pandavas are roaring in delight, though it is a time for them to sorrow. Even the gods, the gandharvas, the asuras, the serpents and the rakshasas are incapable of countering him, not to speak of lords of men. O fortunate ones! O bulls among men! Therefore, give me permission to depart. I wish to disappear, so that Pandava cannot see me.’ Thus did he lament, his senses overcome by fear and anxiety.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2690">‘“King Duryodhana regarded his own task as superior to everything else and spoke these words. ‘O tiger among men! Do not be frightened. O bull among men! When you are stationed in the midst of all these brave kshatriyas, who is going to seek an engagement with you in battle? Other than me, there are Vaikartana Karna, Chitrasena, Vivimshati, Bhurishrava, Shala, Shalya, the unassailable Vrishasena, Purumitra, Jaya, Bhaja, Sudakshina from Kamboja, Satyavrata, the mighty-armed Vikarna, Durmukha, Duhshasana, Subahu, the lord of Kalinga with upraised weapons, Vinda and Anuvinda from Avanti, Drona, Drona’s son and Soubala. O immensely radiant one! You are yourself brave and the foremost among rathas. O Saindhava! How can you see any fear emanating from the Pandaveyas? Eleven <a id="calibre_link-2691" class="calibre2"></a>of my <em class="calibre4">akshouhini</em>s<a id="calibre_link-1183" href="#calibre_link-1272" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">2</sup></a> will be engaged in protecting you and will make endeavours to fight. O Saindhava! Therefore, do not be scared and banish this fear.’ O king! Having been thus assured by your son, Saindhava, accompanied by Duryodhana, went to Drona that very night. O lord of the earth! He touched Drona’s feet, showed obeisance and sat down. He then asked him the following. ‘O illustrious one! In taking aim, striking from a distance, dexterity and firmness in striking, tell me the difference between me and Phalguna. O preceptor! I wish to know the exact difference in learning between me and Arjuna. O lord! Tell me truly and accurately.’</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2692">‘“Drona replied, ‘O son!<a id="calibre_link-1184" href="#calibre_link-1273" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">3</sup></a> You and Arjuna are equal in what you have learned from your teachers. But because of yoga and because of the miseries he has faced, Arjuna is superior to you. In the battle, you should never be terrified on Partha’s account. O son! You will be protected by me from fear. There is no doubt about that. Even the immortals have no influence over someone who is protected by my arms. I will create a vyuha and Partha will not be able to cross that vyuha. Therefore, follow your own dharma and fight without any fear. O lord of men! Follow the path traversed by your fathers and grandfathers. You have studied the Vedas, as is prescribed. You have offered excellent oblations into the fire. You have observed many rites and sacrifices. You should not be frightened because of death. It is<a id="calibre_link-1185" href="#calibre_link-1274" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">4</sup></a> an extremely rare end and cannot be attained by wicked men. It is obtained by those who are immensely fortunate. Through the valour of one’s arms, one can win the celestial and supreme worlds. The Kurus, the Pandavas, the Vrishnis, other men, my son and I are all transient. Think of that. In due order and in due course, all of us will be slain by powerful time. We will go to the other world, carrying our respective deeds with us. Ascetics obtain worlds after tormenting themselves with austerities. Brave kshatriyas who follow the dharma of kshatriyas also attain those.’”</p>

<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2694">‘Sanjaya said, “O king! Having been thus assured by Bharadvaja’s son, Saindhava dismissed all fears of Partha from his heart and set his mind on the battle.”’</p>
<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-2695">Chapter 1030(53)</h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-2696">‘Sanjaya said, “When Partha vowed to kill the king of Sindhu, the mighty-armed Vasudeva spoke to Dhananjaya. ‘You consulted your brothers and took the words of the pledge.<a id="calibre_link-1186" href="#calibre_link-1275" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">5</sup></a> “I will slay Saindhava.” You performed an extremely rash act. Without consulting me, you have taken up an extremely heavy burden. How can we now avoid the ridicule of all the worlds? Spies have been sent by me to the camp of the sons of Dhritarashtra. They returned swiftly and conveyed this information to me. After you took a pledge to kill the king of Sindhu, the sons of Dhritarashtra and Saindhava were frightened at the sounds they heard. They heard roars like lions, mingled with the great sound of musical instruments. They thought that these roars like lions must have a reason and waited. O mighty-armed one! A great sound arose among the Kouravas, among their elephants, horses and infantry and there was the roar of chariot wheels. “Having heard of Abhimanyu’s death, it is certain that Dhananjaya will be enraged and will emerge in the night.”<a id="calibre_link-1187" href="#calibre_link-1276" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">6</sup></a> This was their view and they waited. O one who is devoted to the truth! O one with eyes like lotuses! While they prepared, they heard the truth about the pledge you had taken for the death of the king of Sindhu. All of them, Suyodhana’s advisers and King Jayadratha, were distressed and frightened, like small deer. The lord of Sindhu and Souvira was extremely frightened.<a id="calibre_link-1188" href="#calibre_link-1277" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">7</sup></a> He arose, and with his advisers, <a id="calibre_link-2697" class="calibre2"></a>entered his own camp. At the appropriate time for consultation, they consulted each other about the best course of action. He then went to the assembly of the kings and spoke these words to Suyodhana. “Dhananjaya thinks that I am the one who has caused the death of his son. Therefore, in the midst of the soldiers, he has promised to kill me tomorrow. When Savyasachi takes a vow, the gods, the gandharvas, the asuras, the serpents and the rakshasas are incapable of countering it. Therefore, all of you should protect me in the battle and not allow Dhananjaya to place his foot on your heads and thereby accomplish his objective. O descendant of the Kuru lineage! Therefore, make arrangements to protect me in the battle. O king! Otherwise, grant me permission so that I can return home.” Having been thus addressed, Suyodhana was miserable and hung down his head. On hearing this and learning about the great fear, he silently began to think.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2698">‘“‘On seeing that the king was distressed, Saindhava gently spoke these words, with an eye on his own self-interest and on what would be good for him. “I do not see a brave archer here who is capable of countering Arjuna’s weapons with his own weapons in the great battle. He wields the bow Gandiva and Vasudeva is his aide. Who can stand in front of Arjuna, even if it were to be Shatakratu himself? It has been heard that Partha, on foot, fought with the immensely energetic lord Maheshvara earlier, in the Himalaya mountains.<a id="calibre_link-1189" href="#calibre_link-1278" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">8</sup></a> Urged by the king of the gods, on a single chariot, he killed a thousand <em class="calibre4">danava</em>s who resided in Hiranyapura. Kounteya is now united with the intelligent Vasudeva. It is my view that he is capable of destroying the three worlds, together with the immortals. I desire that you should give me permission to leave. Alternatively, if you so wish, the great-souled Drona and his brave son should protect me.” O Arjuna! Thus addressed by the one who was terribly afflicted, the king himself spoke to the preceptor. “All the arrangements have been made and the chariots have been arrayed. Karna, Bhurishrava, Drona’s son, the invincible Vrishasena, Kripa and the king of Madra&mdash;these six will be at the forefront. Drona will construct a vyuha at the rear. Half of this <a id="calibre_link-2699" class="calibre2"></a>will be in the form of a cart<a id="calibre_link-1190" href="#calibre_link-1279" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">9</sup></a> and half in the form of a lotus. There will be an array in the form of a needle in the midst of the pericarp of the lotus. Jayadratha, the king of Sindhu who is unassailable in battle, will be stationed there, protected by brave ones.” O Partha! There is no doubt that those six rathas are impossible to withstand, in use of the bow, in weapons, in valour, in strength and in lineage. Without vanquishing them and their followers, one cannot reach Jayadratha. Think of the valour of each of those six, not to speak of them united together. O tiger among men! They cannot be defeated easily. We should think again about the best course of action for our welfare. We should consult with our advisers and well-wishers and then determine a successful course of action.’</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2700">‘“Arjuna replied, ‘You think that those six rathas on the side of the sons of Dhritarashtra are superior to me in strength. But it is seen that their valour is equal to half of my own. O Madhusudana! I will sever all their weapons with my weapons. Desiring to kill Jayadratha, you will see me shatter them. In the sight of Drona and his lamenting followers, I will bring down the head of the king of Sindhu on the ground. O Madhusudana! This will be the case even if the Sadhyas, the Rudras, Vasus, the Ashvins, the Maruts with Indra, the Vishvadevas, the asuras, the ancestors, the gandharvas, the suparnas,<a id="calibre_link-1191" href="#calibre_link-1280" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">10</sup></a> the oceans, the mountains, the firmament, heaven, earth, the directions, the lords of the directions, the villages, the forests and all mobile and immobile beings seek to protect the king of Sindhu.

Blood will flow from the bodies of men, elephants and horses. They will be brought down by sharp arrows that descend on them. The arrows released from Gandiva will be as swift as thought or the wind. They will rob the breath of life from the bodies of thousands of men, elephants and horses. In the battle, men will behold terrible weapons descend, those that have been obtained by me from Yama, Kubera, Varuna, Rudra and Indra. All those who wish to protect Saindhava will see their weapons routed in the battle by my <em class="calibre4">brahmana astra.</em><a id="calibre_link-1194" href="#calibre_link-1283" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">13</sup></a> O Keshava! In the battle tomorrow, you will see the earth strewn with the heads of kings, severed by forceful arrows that I release. I will gratify carnivorous beasts and drive away the enemy. I will delight my well-wishers and bring down Saindhava. He has performed great misdeeds. He has been a bad ally.<a id="calibre_link-1195" href="#calibre_link-1284" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">14</sup></a> He has been born in an evil land. Having been killed by me, King Saindhava will cause sorrow among those on his own side. Saindhava has enjoyed the best of milk mixed with rice. But he has been evil in conduct. In the forefront of the battle, you will see him destroyed with my radiant arrows. O Krishna! In the morning, I will accomplish that which will make Suyodhana think that there is no archer in this world who is equal to me in battle. O bull among men! Gandiva is a divine bow and I am the warrior. O Hrishikesha! You are the charioteer. Who is incapable of being vanquished by me? Lakshmi is always present in the moon and water is always present in the ocean. O Janardana! Like that, know that my pledge is always true. Do not disrespect my weapons. Do not disrespect my firm bow. Do not disrespect my strength. Do not disrespect Dhananjaya’s strength of arms. I will go to battle so that I am victorious and am not defeated. Know that because of my pledge, Jayadratha has already been slain in battle. It is certain that the brahman is truth. It is certain that there is humility in the virtuous. <a id="calibre_link-2702" class="calibre2"></a>It is certain that there is prosperity in the wise. It is certain that there is victory in Narayana.’”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2703">‘Sanjaya said, “Having spoken these words to Hrishikesha and having addressed them to his own self too, Vasava’s son once again addressed the lord Keshava in a sonorous tone. ‘When night is over and it is morning, please arrange for my chariot to be prepared. O Krishna! That is your task. The task that has to be undertaken is a grave one.’”’</p>

Knowing that Nara and Narayana<a id="calibre_link-1196" href="#calibre_link-1285" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">15</sup></a> were enraged, the gods, together with Vasava, were distressed. They began to reflect about what would transpire. Extremely terrible and harsh winds began to blow, portending of fearful calamities. A headless torso and a club could be seen on the disc of the sun. Though there were no clouds in the sky, there were thunderstorms, tinged with lightning. The earth, with all its mountains and forests, began to tremble. O great king! The ocean, the habitation of makaras, was turbulent. Rivers flowed in an opposite direction, rather than towards the ocean. The lower and upper lips of rathas, horses, men and elephants trembled. Predatory beasts seemed to be delighted, since Yama’s kingdom would be extended. Mounts wept and released excrement and urine. All these omens were terrible and made the body hair stand up. O bull among the Bharata lineage! On beholding these, all the soldiers on your side were distressed. They heard about the fierce vow that the extremely strong Savyasachi had taken.</p>

Dispel the sorrow from the daughter-in-law and the mother-in-law. O lord! Comfort them with truthful words and assure them with what you say.’ Thus addressed, with a distressed mind, Vasudeva went to Arjuna’s house. He comforted his distressed sister, who was overcome with grief on account of her son. ‘O one born in the Varshneya lineage! Do not grieve, together with your daughter-in-law, for the sake of your son. O timid one! All beings have an end that is determined by destiny. This is especially true of kshatriyas who are born in brave lineages. Your son has attained a death like that. Do not sorrow. This was good fortune for the brave maharatha who was like his father in valour. He has attained the objective decreed for kshatriyas, one that brave ones desire. He has conquered many enemies and sent them to their death. He has gone to the eternal worlds that satisfy all desire, those obtained by those with meritorious deeds. These are obtained by those with austerities, <em class="calibre4">brahmacharya</em>, learning and wisdom. The virtuous go there and your son has obtained them. You are the mother of a hero. You are the wife of a hero. Your father-in-law is a hero and so are your kin. O fortunate one! Do not grieve over a son who has attained the supreme objective. The inferior Saindhava, the slayer of a child, together with his well-wishers, followers and relatives, will reap the fruits of his insolent deeds. O one with the beautiful hips! As soon as night has passed, he will suffer for his wicked acts. Even if he goes to Amaravati,<a id="calibre_link-1199" href="#calibre_link-1288" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">18</sup></a> he will not be able to escape from Partha.

Having placed the dharma of kshatriyas at the forefront, the brave one has attained the virtuous end. We, all the others whose livelihood is based on arms, will also attain that. He was broad in his chest. He possessed mighty arms. He did not retreat from battle. He killed the best. O one with the beautiful hips! Your son has gone to heaven. Overcome your fever. The valiant one obeyed his fathers and those on his mother’s side. Having killed a thousand enemies, the brave maharatha has been slain. O queen! O kshatriya lady! Comfort your daughter-in-law and do not sorrow grievously. O one who brings delight!<a id="calibre_link-1201" href="#calibre_link-1290" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">20</sup></a> You will hear extremely pleasant news tomorrow. Be free from sorrow.

I am unfortunate! You were equal to your father in valour. O son! Having gone forth to fight, how could you have been slain? Your face was as dark as a blue lotus.<a id="calibre_link-1202" href="#calibre_link-1291" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">21</sup></a> It possessed beautiful teeth and beautiful eyes. O son! It is now seen to be covered with the dust raised by battle. You were brave and did not retreat from battle. You possessed an excellent head, neck and arms. Your chest was broad. Your stomach was <a id="calibre_link-2711" class="calibre2"></a>flat. All your limbs were decorated with ornaments. You possessed excellent eyes. You are now mangled with wounds from weapons. On seeing you fall, there is no doubt that all the beings are glancing at you, as if at a rising moon. Earlier, your bed used to be covered with white and expensive sheets. You were used to happiness. Pierced by arrows, how can you sleep on the bare ground now? The brave and mighty-armed one used to be served by supreme women earlier. How can he now have been brought down on the field of battle, served by jackals? Earlier, you used to be delighted by bards, raconteurs and minstrels. You are now served by masses of carnivorous and fierce creatures that are howling. O lord! You had the Pandavas and the brave Vrishnis as your protectors. There were also the brave Panchalas. How could you have been slain, like one without a protector? O son! O unblemished one! I have not been satisfied from looking at you. I am wretched. It is evident that I will have to go to Yama’s eternal abode now. You possessed large eyes. The tips of your hair were excellent. Your words were pleasant and fragrant. Your face was without any blemishes. O son! When will I see it again? Shame on Bhimasena. Shame on Partha, supreme among archers. Shame on the valour of the brave Vrishnis. Shame on the strength of the Panchalas. Shame on the Kekayas, the Chedis, the Matsyas and the Srinjayas. When you went to fight, they did not know how to prevent the fall of the brave one. Today, I see the earth to be empty, bereft of its beauty. Without being able to see Abhimanyu, my eyes are full of sorrow. You were the son of Vasudeva’s sister and that of the wielder of Gandiva. O brave one! How can I see you bereft of your chariot, and brought down by others? Alas, brave one! You are like riches seen in a dream, which have been destroyed now. Man is transient, as temporary as a bubble in water. This is your young wife. She is overcome with grief on your account. How will I comfort her? I am myself like a cow that has lost her calf. O son! You have left me at a wrong time, when you were about to accomplish great things. You have departed without reaping the fruits. I am yearning to see you. There is no doubt that the ways of destiny are extremely difficult to fathom, even by those who are wise. You had Keshava as your protector. But in the battle, you were like one without a <a id="calibre_link-2712" class="calibre2"></a>protector. There are those who perform sacrifices, donate and are of good conduct. There are brahmanas who control their souls. There are those who follow brahmacharya and bathe in sacred places of pilgrimage. There are those who are grateful and generous. There are those who serve their preceptors. There are those who give a thousand <em class="calibre4">dakshina</em>s. All these attain their ends. These ends are obtained by brave ones who fight without retreating. These ends are obtained by brave ones who are slain on the field of battle. May you attain those ends. There are ends obtained by those who donate a thousand cows or perform sacrifices with donations. There are ends for those who give away acceptable houses as gifts. May those ends be yours. Sages, rigid in their vows, attain ends through brahmacharya. There are ends for women with a single husband. O son! Go to those ends. Kings with good conduct attain eternal ends and those who purify and protect themselves and follow the four sacred <em class="calibre4">ashrama</em>s in due order.<a id="calibre_link-1203" href="#calibre_link-1292" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">22</sup></a> There are those who are always compassionate towards the miserable and divide everything equally.<a id="calibre_link-1204" href="#calibre_link-1293" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">23</sup></a> They refrain from wicked tendencies. O son! May you attain those ends. There are those who follow good conduct and observe dharma. There are those who serve their seniors and do not leave their guests dissatisfied. O son! May you go to those ends. Intelligent ones have intercourse with their own wives at the right season. They do not serve the wives of others. O son! May you go to those ends. There are those who look on all beings peacefully. They are devoid of malice and attain ends. There are those who do not cause injury and forgive. They attain ends. There are those who abstain from liquor, meat, vanity and falsehood and those who do not cause pain to others. O son! May you attain those ends. There are those who are modest and learned in all the sacred texts. They are satisfied and have controlled their senses. There are ends obtained by those who are righteous. O son! <a id="calibre_link-2713" class="calibre2"></a>May you attain those ends.’ Distressed and overcome by sorrow, Subhadra lamented in this way.</p>

O supreme among eloquent ones! Tell me. Why are you grieving? Learned ones do not grieve. Sorrow is the destroyer of all deeds. Sorrow delights enemies and afflicts relatives.

There were trees always full of flowers and fruit. There were stones like crystal. Those parts were frequented by lions and tigers and inhabited by many kinds of deer.

Tell me what will be beneficial for you and I will grant you everything.’ On hearing his words, they stood up, hands joined in salutation.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2730">‘“The immensely intelligent Vasudeva and Arjuna satisfied Sharva with a hymn. ‘O Bhava! O Sharva! We bow down before you. O Rudra!

We bow down before you. O one with the thousand arms! We honour you. O one with a thousand eyes and feet! We worship you. O one whose deeds are innumerable! We bow down before you. O one with the golden complexion! O one with the golden armour! O one who is always compassionate towards devotees! O lord! Make us successful through a boon.’ Having worshipped Mahadeva and gratified him, Vasudeva and Arjuna obtained the weapon. Partha was delighted and worshipped the one with the bull on his banner. With dilated eyes, he gazed at the one who was the receptacle of all energy. He always used to make offerings to Vasudeva every night and he beheld these, lying near Tryambaka. Pandava worshipped Krishna and Sharva in his mind and addressed Shankara, desiring the divine weapon.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2732">‘“On learning Partha’s intention and the purport of the boon, the lord god smiled and spoke to Vasudeva and Arjuna. ‘O destroyers of enemies! Near this spot, there is a divine lake that is full of <em class="calibre4">amrita</em>. There, my divine bow and arrow have been secreted a long time ago. I used them to bring down all the enemies of the gods in battle. O Krishnas!<a id="calibre_link-1240" href="#calibre_link-1329" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">59</sup></a> Bring the supreme bow, with the arrow, here.’ Having been thus addressed, those two brave ones went there, with Sharva’s attendants. They went to the celestial lake, as indicated by the one with the bull on his banner, and which was surrounded by hundreds of divine wonders. It was sacred and was the granter of all objects. Without any fear, the rishis Nara and Narayana went there. They went to the lake, which possessed the complexion of the solar disc. Arjuna and Achyuta saw a terrible serpent in the water. There was a second supreme serpent too, with a thousand heads. They saw it vomit giant flames, with radiance like that of the fire. Krishna and <a id="calibre_link-2733" class="calibre2"></a>Partha touched water and joined their hands in salutation. They worshipped the one with the bull on his banner and approached those serpents. They were learned in the Vedas and chanted one hundred hymns in praise of the brahman and Rudra. They bowed before the immeasurable Bhava, who is in every soul. Because of this praise of the greatness of Rudra, those giant serpents gave up their serpent forms and assumed the form of a bow and arrow, the slayer of enemies. Delighted, they grasped the resplendent bow and arrow. Those great-souled ones took them and gave them to the great-minded one.<a id="calibre_link-1241" href="#calibre_link-1330" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">60</sup></a> A brahmachari emerged from the side of the one with the bull on his banner. He was tawny-eyed and he was the resort of austerities. He was powerful and bluish-red. He grasped the best of bows and stood in that spot. He stretched the bow and fixed the arrow to the supreme bow. Pandava noticed how the bow was grasped with the hand and the position. He heard the mantras spoken by Bhava. The one whose valour was unthinkable<a id="calibre_link-1242" href="#calibre_link-1331" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">61</sup></a> grasped everything. The immensely energetic lord<a id="calibre_link-1243" href="#calibre_link-1332" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">62</sup></a> then released the arrow into the lake. The brave one again flung the bow into the lake. Arjuna, whose memory was good, knew that Bhava was gratified. He remembered the boon he had given him in the forest and how he had beheld Shankara.<a id="calibre_link-1244" href="#calibre_link-1333" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">63</sup></a> In his mind, he wished that all this might come true.<a id="calibre_link-1245" href="#calibre_link-1334" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">64</sup></a> Knowing what he desired, Bhava happily gave him the boon. He granted him the terrible pashupata and the fulfilment of his pledge. The body hair of the invincible one<a id="calibre_link-1246" href="#calibre_link-1335" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">65</sup></a> stood up and he thought that his task had been accomplished. Arjuna and Keshava were delighted and praised Maheshvara, with their heads bowed. The brave ones took their leave of Bhava and instantly returned to their own camp. They were filled with great joy. They were as delighted as Indra and Vishnu, when they desired to kill Jambha.”’</p>

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-2736">‘Sanjaya said, “O king! While Krishna and Daruka were conversing in this way, the night ended. The king<a id="calibre_link-1247" href="#calibre_link-1336" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">66</sup></a> arose. <em class="calibre4">Panisvanika</em>s, <em class="calibre4">magadha</em>s, <em class="calibre4">madhuparkika</em>s, <em class="calibre4">vaitalika</em>s and sutas chanted and satisfied that bull among men.<a id="calibre_link-1248" href="#calibre_link-1337" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">67</sup></a> Dancers danced. Singers with sweet voices sang praises in honour of the Kuru lineage.

There were many other musical instruments. Skilled and well-trained ones happily played on them. That loud noise, like the roar of the clouds, seemed to touch the sky and awoke the sleeping Yudhishthira, supreme among kings. He had slept on an extremely expensive and supreme bed and now arose. Having awoken, he went to the bathroom to perform the required acts. There were a hundred and eight young servants, dressed in white. They had themselves bathed and approached, with golden pots that were full. Wearing light garments, he seated himself on his splendid seat.<a id="calibre_link-1250" href="#calibre_link-1339" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">69</sup></a> He was bathed in water in which sandalwood had been mixed and over which mantras had been recited. Well-trained ones rubbed his body with astringent and strong water.<a id="calibre_link-1251" href="#calibre_link-1340" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">70</sup></a> He was washed with fragrant and perfumed water. The mighty armed one smeared his body with yellow sandalwood paste. He wore garlands and dressed himself in clean garments. He faced the east and seated himself, hands joined in salutation. Following the path of the virtuous, Kounteya meditated <a id="calibre_link-2737" class="calibre2"></a>and chanted. He humbly entered the room where a blazing fire was kept.<a id="calibre_link-1252" href="#calibre_link-1341" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">71</sup></a> He offered sacred kindling and oblations, over which mantras had been recited, into the fire. He then emerged from his house.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2738">‘“The king, tiger among men, entered a second room and saw bulls among brahmanas there. Those brahmanas were learned in the Vedas. They were self-controlled and devoted to the Vedas. They had bathed and performed ablutions after the rites. There were one thousand who worshipped the sun and another eight thousand too. The mighty-armed one made them recite pleasant benedictions over him. He offered them the best kind of honey mixed with clarified butter and auspicious fruit. Pandava gave each of those brahmanas a golden <em class="calibre4">nishka</em>,<a id="calibre_link-1253" href="#calibre_link-1342" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">72</sup></a> one hundred ornamented horses, expensive garments, desired dakshina and cows that yielded milk whenever they were touched. Pandu’s son also gave them calves with horns decorated in gold and hooves decorated in silver. He then circumambulated them, the svastikas that increased fortune, the golden <em class="calibre4">nandyavarta</em>s,<a id="calibre_link-1254" href="#calibre_link-1343" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">73</sup></a> the garlands, the pots full of gold and the flaming fire.

Having seen and touched them, Kounteya went to the outer chamber.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2739">‘“O mighty-armed one! The servants were waiting there. They brought an excellent seat that was completely made out of gold and was decorated with pearls and lapis lazuli. It was covered with a supreme carpet, over which an excellent cover had been spread. This supreme and divine seat had been constructed by Vishvakarma himself. When the great-minded Kounteya had seated himself, the servants brought him all his expensive and bright ornaments. O great king! His beauty was such that it increased the sorrow of his enemies. White whisks that possessed the radiance of the moon and had golden handles were used to fan him. He was as radiant as clouds tinged with lightning. He was praised by bards and eulogized by panegyrists. <a id="calibre_link-2740" class="calibre2"></a>Gandharvas began to honour the descendant of the Kuru lineage. In an instant, the loud noise made by the panegyrists arose. The clatter of chariot wheels and the hooves of horses were heard. This mingled with the sounds of bells on elephants and the blare of conch shells. The earth trembled because of the footsteps of men. At that instant, one of those in charge of the gates entered. He was young and armoured. He wore earrings and his sword was girded. He knelt down on the ground and lowered his head in salutation to the one who had dharma in his soul. He told the great-minded one that Hrishikesha had arrived. The tiger among men replied, ‘Let Madhava be welcome. Let a supreme <em class="calibre4">arghya</em><a id="calibre_link-1256" href="#calibre_link-1345" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">75</sup></a> and seat be kept ready for him.’ Varshneya entered and seated himself on that supreme seat. Yudhishthira asked him about his welfare and honoured him with worship.”’</p>
<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-2741">Chapter 1036(59)</h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-2742">‘“Yudhishthira asked, ‘O Madhusudana! Have you spent the night happily? O Achyuta! Are all your senses of wisdom keen?’”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2743">‘Sanjaya said, “Having been thus addressed by Yudhishthira, Vasudeva also asked him similar questions. An ordinary gatekeeper entered and reported that others had also arrived and were waiting for the king’s permission to enter&mdash;Virata, Bhimasena, Dhrishtadyumna, Satyaki, Shikhandi, the twins, Chekitana, the Kekayas, the Kouravya Yuyutsu, the Panchala Uttamouja and many other kshatriyas. They entered, approached the great-souled bull among kshatriyas and seated themselves. The brave, immensely radiant, immensely strong and great-souled Krishna and Yuyudhana seated themselves on a single seat. In their hearing, Yudhishthira spoke these sweet words. ‘O Madhusudana! O Pundarikaksha! You alone are our refuge, like the thousand-eyed one is of the immortals. We depend on you for victory in the battle and for eternal happiness. O Krishna! You <a id="calibre_link-2744" class="calibre2"></a>know everything about the destruction of our kingdom, about our banishment by the enemy and about the many hardships we have had to bear. You are the lord of everything. You are everything to us. You are affectionate towards your devotees. O Madhusudana! Our happiness and our path are vested in you. O Varshneya! My mind is vested in you. Act accordingly. My wish is that Arjuna’s pledge should be true. Help us cross this great ocean of misery and intolerance. O Madhava! We wish to cross over. Be our boat. O Krishna! He is the equal of Kartavirya.<a id="calibre_link-1257" href="#calibre_link-1346" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">76</sup></a> When he has you as his charioteer, there is nothing that ratha cannot accomplish in battle.’ Vasudeva replied, ‘In all the worlds, including that of the immortals, there is no wielder of the bow who is the equal of Partha Dhananjaya. He is valiant and skilled in weapons. He is powerful and immensely strong. He is terrible and wrathful in battle. He is energetic. He is supreme among men. He is young. He has the shoulders of a bull. He is long-armed. He is immensely strong. His gait is like that of a bull among lions. He is handsome. He will slay all your enemies. I will act so that Arjuna, Kunti’s son, consumes the army of the sons of Dhritarashtra, like a fire that has arisen. Through Arjuna’s arrows, the inferior and wicked one, the slayer of Subhadra’s son, will today travel along a path from which no one returns. Vultures, hawks, wild crows, jackals and many other meat-eaters will devour his flesh today. Even if all the gods, together with Indra, seek to protect him today, he will be slain in the encounter and conveyed to Yama’s capital. Having slain Saindhava, Jishnu will return to you today. O king! Be bereft of sorrow and devoid of fever. You will be bedecked with prosperity.’”’</p>
<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-2745">Chapter 1037(60)</h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-2746">‘Sanjaya said, “While they were thus conversing, Dhananjaya arrived. He wished to meet the king who was the foremost <a id="calibre_link-2747" class="calibre2"></a>among the Bharata lineage, together with his well-wishers. He entered the auspicious chamber and having saluted him,<a id="calibre_link-1258" href="#calibre_link-1347" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">77</sup></a> stood in front. The bull among the Pandavas<a id="calibre_link-1259" href="#calibre_link-1348" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">78</sup></a> arose from his seat and affectionately embraced Arjuna with his arms, inhaling the fragrance of his head. Having pronounced his blessings, he smilingly said, ‘O Arjuna! It is evident that you will certainly accomplish a great victory in the battle. Your countenance shows that Janardana is extremely pleased with you.’ Jishnu recounted to him the great and supremely wonderful incident. ‘O fortunate one! I witnessed it through Keshava’s favours.’ Dhananjaya told him everything that he had witnessed and about his encounter with Tryambaka, and thus assured his well-wishers. All of them were astounded and lowered their heads on the ground. Having shown obeisance to the one with the bull on his banner, they spoke words of praise. All the well-wishers then took their leave of Dharma’s son. They swiftly armoured themselves and happily emerged to do battle.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2748">‘“Having shown their honours to King Yudhishthira, Yuyudhana, Achyuta and Arjuna also happily emerged from his abode. The invincible Yuyudhana and Janardana were on a single chariot and together, went to brave Arjuna’s abode. Having gone there, Hrishikesha prepared the chariot, like a charioteer. It was a supreme chariot and bore the signs of the bull among monkeys. It possessed a roar like that of the clouds. It possessed the complexion of molten gold. That supreme of chariots was prepared and was as resplendent as the morning sun. The tiger among men<a id="calibre_link-1260" href="#calibre_link-1349" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">79</sup></a> prepared himself. Having prepared himself, he told Partha, who had finished his morning ablutions, that the chariot was ready. Kiriti, the supreme among men in this world, donned golden armour. With the bow and arrows in his hand, he circumabulated.<a id="calibre_link-1261" href="#calibre_link-1350" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">80</sup></a> The learned and the aged, who were in control of their senses and had performed rites, pronounced benedictions for the maharatha’s victory. The supreme chariot had <a id="calibre_link-2749" class="calibre2"></a>earlier been invoked with mantras that would bring about triumph in battle. Having been invoked with mantras, it dazzled like the rays of the morning sun. The foremost among rathas, clad in gold, ascended the golden chariot. He was as resplendent as the unblemished rays of the sun on Meru. After Partha had ascended, Yuyudhana and Janardana also climbed up,<a id="calibre_link-1262" href="#calibre_link-1351" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">81</sup></a> like the Ashvins coming with Indra to Sharyati’s sacrifice.<a id="calibre_link-1263" href="#calibre_link-1352" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">82</sup></a> Govinda, supreme among those who hold reins, grasped the reins, like Matali for Vasava,<a id="calibre_link-1264" href="#calibre_link-1353" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">83</sup></a> when he departed to slay Vritra. Partha was with both of them, on that supreme chariot. He was like the moon, the dispeller of darkness, together with Budha and Shukra.<a id="calibre_link-1265" href="#calibre_link-1354" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">84</sup></a> The destroyer of large numbers of the enemy departed, wishing to kill Saindhava. He was like Indra in Tarakamaya,<a id="calibre_link-1266" href="#calibre_link-1355" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">85</sup></a> accompanied by the lord of the oceans<a id="calibre_link-1267" href="#calibre_link-1356" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">86</sup></a> and Mitra. There was the sound of musical instruments and auspicious and sacred chants. Arjuna proceeded, praised by bards and minstrels. The auspicious chants of bards and minstrels wished for his victory. These mingled with the sound of musical instruments and became extremely pleasant. Auspicious winds began to blow from the rear, with fragrant scents. They delighted Partha and dried up his enemies. O venerable one! Many omens of victory manifested themselves in favour of the Pandavas and it was the reverse for those on your side.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2750">‘“On beholding these signs of victory, Arjuna spoke to the great archer, Yuyudhana, who was on his right. ‘O Yuyudhana! I can see that victory is certain in the battle. O bull among the Shini lineage! These good portents can be seen. Let me go to the spot where King Saindhava is. He is waiting to witness my valour and to proceed to Yama’s world. The slaying of Saindhava is the supreme task for me. It is also a great task to protect Dharmaraja. O mighty-armed one! <a id="calibre_link-2751" class="calibre2"></a>You protect him today. You will protect him the way I would have protected him myself. I do not see anyone else I can depend on, with the exception of maharatha Pradyumna. O bull among men! Ignoring this,<a id="calibre_link-1268" href="#calibre_link-1357" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">87</sup></a> I can then kill Saindhava. O Satvata! You should not entertain any anxiety on my account. Devote all your attention to the supreme task of protecting the king. Where the mighty-armed Vasudeva is stationed, and where I am, it is certain that there is no scope for danger there.’ Thus addressed by Partha, Satyaki, the destroyer of enemy heroes, signified his assent to the words and went to the spot where King Yudhishthira was.”’</p>

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-2762">‘Dhritarashtra said, “After Abhimanyu had been killed, the next day arrived. They<a id="calibre_link-345" href="#calibre_link-938" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">1</sup></a> were oppressed with sorrow and grief. What did they do? Who, from my side, fought with them? The Kurus knew about Savyasachi’s deeds. Knowing this, how could they, and those on my side, fearlessly perform this wicked deed? Tell me. The tiger among men<a id="calibre_link-346" href="#calibre_link-939" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">2</sup></a> was tormented by sorrow on account of his son. He was enraged. He was like Death, the destroyer. When he advanced in that battle, how could they glance at him? In the battle, the one with the ape on his banner shook his giant bow, grieving on account of his son. On beholding him, what did those on my side do? O Sanjaya! What did Duryodhana confront in the course of the battle? A great sorrow has overtaken us today. I do not hear sounds of joy.<a id="calibre_link-347" href="#calibre_link-940" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">3</sup></a> Those are sounds pleasant to the mind. They bring happiness to the ear. Today, all of those can no longer be heard in Saindhava’s abode. The praises I heard earlier in the camps of my sons, can no longer be heard today. There were masses of bards and minstrels and dancers everywhere. Earlier, those sounds used to strike my ears. But I no longer hear them today. They must be miserable today and I can no longer hear those sounds. O Sanjaya! O son!<a id="calibre_link-348" href="#calibre_link-941" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">4</sup></a> Earlier, seated in the abodes of Satyadhriti and Somadatta, I used to hear those supreme sounds, charming to the ears.<a id="calibre_link-349" href="#calibre_link-942" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">5</sup></a> My merits have diminished today and <a id="calibre_link-2763" class="calibre2"></a>I hear woes and lamentations from the abodes of my sons. I perceive that they have lost their enterprise. That is the reason I do not hear such sounds from Vivimshati, Durmukha, Chitrasena, Vikarna and my other sons. Drona’s son, the great archer, is devoted to my sons. Brahmanas, kshatriyas, vaishyas and disciples used to wait upon him. He found delight in debate, talk and conversation and in the playing of musical instruments. Day and night, he found pleasure in many kinds of songs. He was worshipped by many from the Kurus, the Pandavas and the Satvatas. O suta! In the house of Drona’s son, sounds cannot be heard today, as they used to be earlier. Drona’s son, the great archer, used to be worshipped by multitudes of dancers and singers. Those sounds cannot be heard there now. Every evening, a great sound arose from the camps of Vinda and Anuvinda. It cannot be heard today. Every day, from the houses of the Kekayas, great sounds of rhythmic singing and dancing could be heard, as they and their soldiers amused themselves. O son! Those sounds are non-existent today. Somadatta’s son<a id="calibre_link-350" href="#calibre_link-943" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">6</sup></a> is a store of learning. Officiating priests, learned in <em class="calibre4">saptatantu</em><a id="calibre_link-351" href="#calibre_link-944" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">7</sup></a> sacrifices, used to wait upon him. Those sounds cannot be heard. The twang of bowstrings, the praise of the brahman and the sounds of lances, swords and chariots could be incessantly heard from Drona’s house. But they cannot be heard now. There were the sounds of singing from those from many different countries and the playing of musical instruments. Those great sounds cannot be heard today. Janardana Achyuta arrived in Upaplavya, compassionate towards all beings and desiring peace.<a id="calibre_link-352" href="#calibre_link-945" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">8</sup></a> O suta! At that time, I told my wicked son, ‘O son! Use Vasudeva as a place of pilgrimage and have peace with the Pandavas. O Duryodhana! I think that the time has come and do not cross me. Do not refuse Keshava, who has come to solicit peace. He has your welfare in mind. Otherwise, you will truly <a id="calibre_link-2764" class="calibre2"></a>be defeated.’ But he refused Dasharha, who is a bull among all archers, and who was entreating him. He brought calamity on himself. The evil-minded one was attracted by destiny and ignored my beneficial words. He accepted the views of Duhshasana and Karna. I did not desire the game with the dice. Nor did Vidura approve of it. Saindhava did not desire the gambling. Bhishma did not desire the gambling. O Sanjaya! Shalya, Bhurishrava, Purumitra, Jaya, Ashvatthama, Kripa and Drona did not desire the gambling either. If my son had acted in accordance with the views of these people, with his kin and his well-wishers, he would have had a long and peaceful life. ‘The sons of Pandu are pleasant and sweet in speech.<a id="calibre_link-353" href="#calibre_link-946" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">9</sup></a> In the midst of their kin, they speak pleasantly. They are born in noble lineages. They are revered and wise. They will obtain happiness. A man who is always on the side of dharma, obtains happiness everywhere. After death, he obtains welfare and favours. Based on their capacity, they deserve to enjoy half of the earth. Right up to the frontiers of the ocean, the earth is also theirs, from their fathers and grandfathers. Obtaining their stations, the Pandavas will remain devoted to dharma. O son! I have kin and the Pandavas will always listen to them&mdash;Shalya, Somadatta, the great-souled Bhishma, Drona, Vikarna, Bahlika, Kripa and other aged and great-souled ones among the Bharata lineage. O son! If they speak on your behalf, they will act in accordance with those words. Do you think that there is any among them<a id="calibre_link-354" href="#calibre_link-947" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">10</sup></a> who will speak in a contrary way? Krishna will never give up dharma and all of them will follow him. Those brave ones will not act contrary to the words of dharma that I speak to them. The Pandavas have dharma in their soul.’ O suta! Thus did I lament and speak many words to my son. But the stupid one did not listen. It seems to me that all this is because of destiny. Vrikodara and Arjuna are there and brave Satyaki from the Vrishni lineage. There are Uttamouja from Panchala, the invincible Yudhamanyu, the unassailable Dhrishtadyumna, the unvanquished Shikhandi, the Ashmakas, the Kekayas, Kshatradharma from the <a id="calibre_link-2765" class="calibre2"></a>Somakas, Chekitana from Chedi, Abhibhu, the son of Kashi, the sons of Droupadi, Virata, maharatha Drupada and the twins, tigers among men. Madhusudana is the counsellor. Who in this world wishes to fight the likes of these and desires to live? Who will withstand my enemies when they exhibit their divine weapons? There are Duryodhana, Karna, Shakuni Soubala and Duhshasana as the fourth. I do not see a fifth. They have Vishvaksena<a id="calibre_link-355" href="#calibre_link-948" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">11</sup></a> stationed on the chariot, reins in his hand. The armoured Arjuna is the warrior. There cannot be defeat. Does Duryodhana not remember those lamentations of mine? You have told me that Bhishma and Drona, tigers among men, have been brought down. Those were the words spoken by Vidura, the far-sighted one. Beholding the fruits of those deeds, I think that my sons must be sorrowing. At the end of the winter, aided by a great wind, the fire consumes dry wood. Thus will Dhananjaya consume my soldiers. O Sanjaya! You are skilled in narrating. Tell me everything. O son! When Abhimanyu was slain and that wicked deed was done to Partha in the evening, what was the state of your minds? O son! Having performed that wicked deed, in battle, those on my side must have found it impossible to withstand the deeds of the wielder of Gandiva. What did Duryodhana do? What did Karna do and say? When they confronted this end, what about Duhshasana and Soubala? O Sanjaya! O son! Everything that befell my assembled sons in battle was because of wicked and intolerant deeds. The evil-minded one<a id="calibre_link-356" href="#calibre_link-949" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">12</sup></a> was addicted to avarice. His mind was distorted because of anger. The stupid one coveted the kingdom. Hatred made him lose his senses. O Sanjaya! Tell me whether their actions were good or evil.”’</p>
<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-2766">Chapter 1039(62)</h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-2767">‘Sanjaya said, “I will tell you everything, as I have seen it with my own eyes. Listen with patience. Your faults have been great. <a id="calibre_link-2768" class="calibre2"></a>When waters have receded after a flood, the construction of an embankment is useless. O king! O bull among the Bharata lineage! Lamentation is pointless. Do not sorrow. Know that the decrees of destiny are wonderful and cannot be transgressed. O best among the Bharata lineage! Do not grieve. This destiny is ancient. If, in earlier times, you had restrained Yudhishthira, Kunti’s son, or your own sons from gambling with the dice, you would not have confronted this calamity. Yet again, when the time for battle arrived, had you restrained both the angry parties, you would not have confronted this calamity. If, in earlier times, you had instructed the Kurus to kill the disobedient Duryodhana, you would not have confronted this calamity. Then the Pandavas, the Panchalas, the Vrishnis and all the other great ones would never have blamed you for your lack of intelligence. Had you performed the duties of a father and directed your son to a righteous path, making him follow dharma, you would not have confronted this calamity. You are the wisest person in this world, but you abandoned eternal dharma, following the counsel of Duryodhana, Karna and Shakuni. O king! You are addicted to artha. And all these lamentations of yours that I hear seem to be like honey laced with poison. O king! In earlier times, Krishna did not revere the Pandava king,<a id="calibre_link-357" href="#calibre_link-950" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">13</sup></a> Bhishma or Drona as much as he revered you. But when he knew that you had been dislodged from the dharma of kings, from that time, Krishna no longer regards you with high honour. When your sons addressed harsh words towards the Parthas, despite they being under your control, you remained indifferent, coveting the kingdom for them. O unblemished one! You obtained the kingdom from your fathers and grandfathers and it will be lost. And so will the entire earth that has been conquered by the Parthas.<a id="calibre_link-358" href="#calibre_link-951" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">14</sup></a> The fame and the kingdom of the Kouravas are because of what the sons of Pandus won. The Pandavas followed dharma and added a lot to those. But having encountered you, those deeds of theirs became extremely fruitless. They were dislodged from their <a id="calibre_link-2769" class="calibre2"></a>kingdom because of your avarice. O king! Now that the time for battle has arrived, you are censuring your sons. You have indicated the many faults that they possess. But this is not deserved. When kings fight in battle, they do not seek to protect their lives. The bulls among kshatriyas are fighting, penetrating the army of the Parthas. Who other than the Kouravas will seek to fight with an army of soldiers protected by Krishna, Arjuna, Satyaki and Vrikodara? Their warrior is Gudakesha<a id="calibre_link-359" href="#calibre_link-952" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">15</sup></a> and their counsellor is Janardana. They are protected by Satyaki and they are protected by Vrikodara. Other than the Kouravas and those who are following them, which mortal archer would dare to fight against these? With the devoted kings, the brave Kouravas are doing whatever they are capable of, devoted to the dharma of kshatriyas. Now listen to the supremely grievous battle between those tigers among men, the Kurus and the Pandavas. Listen exactly to everything that occurred.”’</p>
<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-2770">Chapter 1040(63)</h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-2771">‘Sanjaya said, “After night had passed, Drona, supreme among the wielders of weapons, started to arrange all his arrays in the form of a vyuha. O king! The brave ones roared in anger and intolerance. As they sought to kill each other, many wonderful sounds were heard. They stretched their bows and touched the bowstrings with their palms. They sighed deeply and exclaimed, ‘Where is that Dhananjaya?’ Others unsheathed their sharp, yellow and well-tempered swords, which had decorated hilts and the complexion of the sky, and tossed them up. Thousands of brave ones were seen, their minds set on war. They were skilled and roamed around, performing the motions for swords and bows. Others raised clubs, decorated with bells, gold and diamonds and smeared with sandalwood paste, and asked about the Pandavas. Still others possessed arms like clubs <a id="calibre_link-2772" class="calibre2"></a>and were intoxicated with their strength. They raised these<a id="calibre_link-360" href="#calibre_link-953" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">16</sup></a> and obstructed the sky, as if with Indra’s standards. Others wielded many weapons and were garlanded with colourful flowers. Those brave ones desired to do battle and were stationed there. ‘Where is Arjuna? Where is Govinda? Where is the proud Vrikodara? Where are their well-wishers?’ Thus did they summon them to battle then.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2773">‘“Drona blew on his conch shell and himself urged his horses to speed up. He swiftly roamed around here and there. All the arrays that delighted in battle were stationed. O great king! Bharadvaja’s son then spoke to Jayadratha. ‘You yourself, Somadatta’s son, maharatha Karna, Ashvatthama, Shalya, Vrishasena and Kripa will be stationed three <em class="calibre4">govyuti</em>s<a id="calibre_link-361" href="#calibre_link-954" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">17</sup></a> behind me, with a hundred thousand horses, sixty thousand chariots, fourteen thousand elephants with rent temples and twenty-one thousand armoured infantry. There the gods, with Vasava, will not be able to attack you, not to speak of all the Pandavas. O Saindhava! Therefore, be assured.’ Thus addressed, Jayadratha, king of Sindhu, was comforted. He went to the spot indicated, surrounded by maharathas from Gandhara. Armoured foot soldiers were stationed there, with lances in their hands. All of them had whisks decorated with gold. O Indra among kings! Jayadratha’s horses were well trained. There were seventy-two thousand Saindhava horses. Wishing to fight, your son, Durmarshana, stationed himself at the forefront of all those soldiers. He was with fifteen hundred crazy and armoured elephants that were terrible in form and were the performers of fierce deeds. Those who were skilled in fighting with elephants were astride them. To accomplish the objectives of the king of Sindhu, your sons, Duhshasana and Vikarna, also stationed themselves ahead of the soldiers. The vyuha that Bharadvaja’s son constructed was partly in the form of a chakra and partly in the form of a cart.<a id="calibre_link-362" href="#calibre_link-955" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">18</sup></a> It was twelve govyutis long and extended for five at the rear. Many brave kings were stationed there. There were chariots, <a id="calibre_link-2774" class="calibre2"></a>horses, elephants and infantry, stationed by Drona himself. At its rear, there was a core vyuha in the form of a lotus. It was extremely difficult to penetrate. In the midst of the lotus, he again created a deep vyuha in the form of a needle. Having created the great vyuha in this fashion, Drona stationed himself in the vyuha. The great archer, Kritavarma, was stationed at the mouth of the needle. O venerable one! Kamboja and Jalasandha were stationed next to him. And next to them was Duryodhana, with his advisers. There were hundreds and thousands of warriors who never retreated. All of them stationed themselves in the cart, intending to protect it for a long time. O king! King Jayadratha was behind them, to the side of the needle, and surrounded by a large force. O Indra among kings! Bharadvaja’s son stationed himself at the mouth of the cart. Bhoja was behind him, so as to protect him. Drona was clad in white armour, garments and headdress. He was broad-chested and mighty-armed. He was stationed there and stretched his bow, as angry as Death. On beholding Drona’s chariot, the Kurus were delighted. It possessed a standard and was yoked to red horses. The signs of an altar and black deerskin were on the standard. On seeing the vyuha constructed by Drona, which was like an agitating ocean, the siddhas and the charanas were filled with great wonder. All the beings thought that this vyuha would devour the entire earth, with the mountains, the oceans, the forests and the many countries. The king<a id="calibre_link-363" href="#calibre_link-956" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">19</sup></a> was delighted on seeing the great cart, which would shatter the hearts of those who caused it ill. It had many chariots, men, horses, infantry and elephants. It was wonderful in form and its roar gave rise to fear.”’</p>
<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-2775">Chapter 1041(64)</h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-2776">‘Sanjaya said, “O venerable one! When the battle formations had thus been arrayed and a great sound arose, drums and kettledrums were beaten. When the battle formations roared and <a id="calibre_link-2777" class="calibre2"></a>musical instruments were sounded, conch shells were blown and the sound made the body hair stand up. The ground was slowly covered with those among the Bharata lineage who wished to fight. The <em class="calibre4">roudra muhurta</em><a id="calibre_link-364" href="#calibre_link-957" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">20</sup></a> arrived and Savyasachi was seen. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! Many thousand wild crows and crows sported themselves in front of Savyasachi. Animals howled in terrible tones, and jackals, inauspicious to look at, howled and advanced on our right, as we proceeded. Flaming meteors roared and fell down in every direction. The entire earth trembled and a dreadful fear arose. Dry and harsh winds began to blow, attracting gravel. They manifested themselves when Kounteya arrived to do battle. Shatanika, Nakula’s son, and Parshata Dhrishtadyumna&mdash;those two wise ones arrayed the Pandava soldiers into a vyuha. Your son, Durmarshana, stationed himself in front of all the soldiers, with one thousand chariots, one hundred elephants, three thousand horses and ten thousand foot soldiers. These covered terrain measuring fifteen hundred bows. He said, ‘The wielder of Gandiva is unassailable in battle. He is a scorcher. But today, I will repulse him, like the shoreline against the abode of makaras. Let everyone witness the invincible and intolerant Dhananjaya clash against me in battle today, like a mass of stones against another mass of stones.’ O great king! Having said, this, the great-souled and high-minded and great archer stationed himself there. O king! He was surrouned by great archers. He was as angry as the Destroyer and like Vasava with the vajra. Urged by destiny, he was like Death with a staff in his hand. He was as unagitated as the one with the trident,<a id="calibre_link-365" href="#calibre_link-958" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">21</sup></a> or like Varuna with his noose. He was like the blazing fire that arrives at the end of a yuga to consume beings. The angry and intolerant Jaya,<a id="calibre_link-366" href="#calibre_link-959" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">22</sup></a> the destroyer of the nivatakavachas, was established in victory and truth. He desired to accomplish his great vow. He was armoured. Kiriti wielded a sword that was embellished <a id="calibre_link-2778" class="calibre2"></a>with gold. His armour and garments were white. He sported a sword and wore beautiful earrings. Nara, with Narayana, was stationed on a supreme chariot. Shaking Gandiva in battle, he was as resplendent as the rising sun. Dhananjaya stationed his prepared chariot at the forefront of the array, where the great shower of arrows would descend. The powerful one blew on his conch shell. O venerable one! Together with Partha, Krishna also fearlessly blew on Panchajanya, supreme among conch shells, with great energy. O lord of the earth! Because of the sound of the conch shells, your soldiers trembled. Their body hair stood up and they lost their senses. Like all beings are terrified at the sound of thunder, all your soldiers were frightened at the sound of the conch shells. All the mounts released urine and excrement. The entire army, with all the mounts, became anxious. O king! O venerable one! The men were distressed at the sound of the conch shells. Some of them lost their senses. O king! Some were terrified. Together with all the other beings who dwelt on the standard, the ape let out a mighty roar. To frighten your soldiers, it opened its mouth wide. At this, so as to delight your soldiers, conch shells, drums, kettledrums and tambourines were again sounded. This mixed with the sound of many musical instruments, with the roars and the slapping of arms. To the sound of musical instruments, the maharathas roared like lions and issued challenges. There was a tumultuous sound that increased the fear of cowards.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2779">‘“The son of the chastiser of Paka<a id="calibre_link-367" href="#calibre_link-960" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">23</sup></a> was extremely delighted. He told Dasharha, ‘O Hrishikesha! Urge the horses to the spot where Durmarshana is stationed. I will shatter the army of elephants and penetrate the enemy’s force.’ Having been thus addressed by Savyasachi, the mighty-armed Keshava urged the horses to the spot where Durmarshana was stationed. A tumultuous and extremely fierce clash commenced between one and many,<a id="calibre_link-368" href="#calibre_link-961" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">24</sup></a> one that destroyed chariots, elephants and men. Partha showered down arrows on the enemy, like Parjanya<a id="calibre_link-369" href="#calibre_link-962" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">25</sup></a> pouring down rain. He was like a cloud <a id="calibre_link-2780" class="calibre2"></a>raining down on a mountain. All the rathas swiftly displayed their dexterity of hand. They enveloped Krishna and Dhananjaya with a net of arrows. When the foe fought against him, the mighty-armed and valiant Partha became enraged. With his arrows, he severed the heads of the rathas from their bodies. The earth was strewn with these, with handsome heads with eyes jutting out and frowning, with teeth biting the lips. They were adorned with earrings and helmets. In every direction, they were like lotuses that had been destroyed. The heads of the warriors were scattered around. Colourful armour was spattered with blood. O king! They were seen there, like masses of clouds, tinged with lightning. O king! There was the sound of heads falling down on the surface of the earth, like palm fruit that has ripened in time and is falling down. Some torsos were stationed, with the hands still wielding bows. Some upraised arms were stationed with unsheathed swords. Those bulls among men did not even know when their heads were severed and fell down. They could not tolerate Kounteya and wished to defeat him in battle. The earth was strewn with the heads of horses, trunks of elephants and the arms and heads of brave ones. ‘This is Partha. Where is Partha? This one is Partha!’ O lord! Thus, your soldiers and warriors only thought about Partha. Deluded by destiny, they thought that the entire world was full of Partha alone. Thus, they struck and killed each other. Others struck their own selves. They destroyed themselves. They were covered in blood. They were bereft of their senses. Their bodies were in deep pain. Many brave ones lay down and called out to their well-wishers. The arms held slings, lances, spears, swords, battleaxes, helmets, scimitars, bows, arrows, javelins, darts, armour, ornaments, clubs and armlets in that battle. The arms were like clubs and giant snakes. Having been severed by those supreme arrows, they seemed to forcefully jump, twitch and jerk in every direction, as if in anger. Any man who wrathfully advanced against Partha in that battle was killed by his arrows, piercing the body. As he brandished his bow and danced around on the coursing chariot, no one could detect any weakness in Partha. He swiftly picked up arrows, affixed them and shot them. All the enemy soldiers marvelled <a id="calibre_link-2781" class="calibre2"></a>at the dexterity of Pandu’s son. Phalguna used his arrows to pierce elephants and elephant-riders, horses and horse-riders and rathas and their charioteers. There were many who whirled around and surrounded and fought with Pandava. There was not a single one who stood before him and was not killed. Like the sun arises in the sky and destroys great darkness, thus did Arjuna use arrows tufted with heron feathers to slay that army of elephants. Because of the shattered and fallen elephants and soldiers, the earth seemed to be strewn with mountains, as if it was the time of destruction. Beings are always incapable of looking at the midday sun. Like that, the angry Dhananjaya was incapable of being glanced at by the enemy warriors. O scorcher of enemies! Your son’s soldiers were shattered and fled. They were routed and oppressed by those arrows. Like a mass of clouds scattered by a giant wind, those soldiers were slain and no one was capable of looking at him. Those on your side used goads, the tips of their bows, shouts, whips, lashes on the flanks and eloquent words to swiftly urge their well-controlled horses to run away. The riders, the charioteers and the foot soldiers were afflicted by Arjuna. Others used goads and their toes to urge the elephants on their flanks. Others were confounded by the arrows and fled in his direction. Your warriors lost their endeavour. They were confused and distracted in their minds.”’</p>

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-2783">‘Dhritarashtra asked, “The forefront of my army was shattered and slain by Kiriti. In the battle, who were the brave ones who advanced against Dhananjaya? Or did they abandon their certain resolution and enter the shakata vyuha, seeking refuge with the fearless Drona, who was stationed like a wall?”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2784">‘Sanjaya replied, “Arjuna shattered your forces then. Brave ones were slain and lost their endeavour. They fled at that moment. They were slain by the supreme arrows and no one was capable of looking <a id="calibre_link-2785" class="calibre2"></a>at the son of the chastiser of Paka. O king! Duhshasana, your son, saw the state that the soldiers were in and was filled with great rage. To fight, he advanced against Arjuna. He was covered in colourful armour made out of gold. The brave one was extremely valorous and his helmet was made out of god. O great king! Duhshasana surrounded Savyasachi with a giant army of elephants that seemed to devour the earth. Bells tinkled on the elephants. There was the sound of conch shells. There was the sound of bows being twanged and the roars of the tuskers. The sound enveloped the earth, the directions and the sky. That moment was seen to be extremely fierce and terrible. On seeing that these were angry and were swiftly descending on him, urged by goads, and with extended trunks, like winged mountains, Dhananjaya, lion among men, emitted a giant roar, like a lion. He started to afflict and pierce that army of elephants with his arrows. It was like a makara penetrating the great ocean, when it is agitated by mighty waves. Like that, Kiriti penetrated that army of elephants. He was like a scorching sun that rises at the time of the destruction of a yuga, transgressing the normal rules of time.<a id="calibre_link-370" href="#calibre_link-963" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">26</sup></a> Partha, the destroyer of enemy cities, was seen in all the directions. There were sounds from the hooves of the horses and the wheels of chariots. Those who were fighting, roared. There was the twang of bowstrings. There was the sound of Devadatta<a id="calibre_link-371" href="#calibre_link-964" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">27</sup></a> and the roar of Gandiva. Elephants lost their speed and were bereft of their senses. Savyasachi’s arrows had the touch of virulent serpents and shattered them. Sharp arrows released from Gandiva pierced the elephants in that battle and there were many hundreds and thousands that afflicted all their limbs. They roared loudly and were killed by Kiriti. They incessantly fell down on the ground, like mountains with their wings lopped off. Some elephants were pierced with arrows in the roots of their tusks, their frontal lobes and their temples. They repeatedly shrieked like cranes. Using broad-headed arrows with straight tufts, Kiriti sliced down the heads of men who were seated <a id="calibre_link-2786" class="calibre2"></a>on the shoulders of elephants. The heads were adorned with earrings and fell down on the ground. They looked like a mass of lotuses that Partha was rendering as an offering. Some elephants wandered around in that battle. They possessed harnesses, but were devoid of armour. They suffered from wounds and blood flowed from these. Men were seen to hang down from them. Sometimes two or three were pierced with a single arrow that had been released, and fell down on the ground. With broad-headed and straight-tufted arrows, he severed bowstrings, bows, standards, yokes and headdresses of the opposing rathas. No one could detect a gap between his picking up an arrow and affixing and releasing it. Partha seemed to be dancing around, with his bow stretched in a circle. They were pierced with iron arrows and vomited blood from their mouths. In an instant, the elephants were seen to fall down on the ground. Many headless torsos were seen to stand up in every direction. O great king! It was a dreadful carnage. Arms decorated with golden ornaments were seen to be severed in the battle, with bows, finger-guards, swords and armlets. There were many shattered seats, housings, headdresses, poles, chariot wheels, axles and yokes. Shields, bows and arrows were strewn around everywhere. Garlands, ornaments, garments and giant standards fell down. Elephants, horses and kshatriyas were killed and brought down. Because of these, the earth there was seen to be dreadful. Thus did Kiriti slaughter Duhshasana’s army. O great king! They were afflicted and fled, together with their leader.<a id="calibre_link-372" href="#calibre_link-965" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">28</sup></a> With his soldiers, Duhshasana was oppressed and terrified. Seeking a protector in Drona, he went to the shakata vyuha.”’</p>

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-2788">‘Sanjaya said, “Having slaughtered Duhshasana’s force, Savyasachi Dhananjaya wished to get at the king of Sindhu and <a id="calibre_link-2789" class="calibre2"></a>attacked Drona’s army. He approached Drona, who was stationed at the mouth of the vyuha. Instructed by Krishna, he joined his hands in salutation and spoke these words. ‘O brahmana! Wish me well and pronounce benedictions over me. Through your favours, I wish to penetrate this impenetrable army. You are like my father. For me, you are the equal of Dharmaraja. You are the equal of Krishna. I tell you this truthfully. O father!<a id="calibre_link-373" href="#calibre_link-966" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">29</sup></a> O unblemished one! O supreme among brahmanas! Like Ashvatthama should be protected by you, like that, I should always be protected by you. O best of men! Through your favours, I wish to kill the king of Sindhu in this battle. O lord! Protect my pledge.’ Having been thus addressed, the preceptor smiled and replied, ‘O Bibhatsu! Without vanquishing me, you are incapable of defeating Jayadratha.’ Having said this, Drona smiled and enveloped him, his charioteer, his chariot, his horses and his standard with a storm of sharp arrows.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2790">‘“At this, Arjuna used his own arrows to repulse Drona’s storm of arrows. He attacked Drona and released more terrible and greater arrows. O lord of the earth! Having shown reverence to Drona, he pierced him in that battle. He resorted to the dharma of kshatriyas and pierced him again with nine arrows. Drona severed these arrows and pierced both Krishna and Pandava with his own arrows, which were like poison or the flaming fire. Pandava then thought of using his arrows to sever Drona’s bow. But while the great-souled Phalguna was thus thinking, Drona acted vigorously. The valiant one used arrows to swiftly sever his<a id="calibre_link-374" href="#calibre_link-967" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">30</sup></a> bowstring and pierced his horses, standard and charioteer. The brave one smiled and shrouded Arjuna with arrows. At this, Partha strung a great bow. He was supreme among those who were skilled in the use of all weapons and was better than the preceptor. He quickly released six hundred arrows, as if he had grasped one alone. He again shot seven hundred arrows, and another one thousand. These were impossible to repluse. He again shot another ten thousand arrows and killed many in Drona’s army. <a id="calibre_link-2791" class="calibre2"></a>He was truly powerful and wonderful in fighting. Men, elephants and horses were pierced by those and fell down, bereft of their lives. They fled from the field of battle, or fell down dead, their weapons severed. There were rathas on the best of chariots and horses and they were afflicted by the arrows. They were crushed, dispersed and burnt, as if by the vajra, the wind or the fire. Elephants that were like mountain peaks, clouds and large houses fell down. Wounded by Arjuna’s arrows, thousands of horses fell down. They were like swans on the breast of the Himalayas, struck by a torrent of water. Wounded by Pandava’s arrows, chariots, horses, elephants and infantry were like large masses of water, dried up by the sun at the end of a yuga. Pandava’s net of arrows was like the rays of the sun. But Drona was like a cloud that forcefully showered down arrows, and that brave and foremost warrior among the Kurus enveloped him. This was like a cloud covering the rays of the sun. Drona then struck Dhananjaya in the chest with an iron arrow. It was released with great force and could drink up the enemy’s blood. He<a id="calibre_link-375" href="#calibre_link-968" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">31</sup></a> trembled in all his limbs, like a mountain during an earthquake. However, Bibhatsu resorted to fortitude and struck Drona with arrows. Drona used five arrows to strike Vasudeva, pierced Arjuna with seventy-three and pierced his standard with three. O king! The powerful Drona got the better of his disciple. In an instant, he made Arjuna disappear with his shower of arrows. As his bow was drawn in the form of a circle, we saw the arrows of Bharadvaja’s son descend continuously and it was extraordinary. O king! In the battle, the large number of arrows released by Drona was shafted with the feathers of herons. They descended on Vasudeva and Dhananjaya. The likes of the battle between Drona and Pandava had never been seen.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2792">‘“The immensely intelligent Vasudeva started to think about what should be done. Vasudeva addressed Dhananjaya in these words. ‘O Partha! O Partha! O mighty-armed one! We should not be wasting time. Abandon Drona and let us perform the greater task.’ Partha told Krishna, ‘O Keshava! It shall be as you wish.’ The mighty-armed Bibhatsu circumambulated Drona and departed, glancing <a id="calibre_link-2793" class="calibre2"></a>backwards and shooting arrows. Drona spoke to him. ‘O Pandava! Where are you going? Is it not true that you do not retreat until you have vanquished the enemy in battle?’ Arjuna replied, ‘You are my preceptor. You are not my enemy. I am your disciple and am like your son. Nor is there any man in this world who can vanquish you in battle.’ Having spoken these words, the mighty-armed Bibhatsu advanced against the soldiers, wishing to slay Jayadratha. His wheels were guarded by the Panchalas, Yudhamanyu and Uttamouja. They followed the great-souled one, as he penetrated your army. O great king! Jaya, Satvata Kritavarma, the king of Kamboja<a id="calibre_link-376" href="#calibre_link-969" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">32</sup></a> and Shrutayu countered Dhananjaya. They had ten thousand rathas as their followers&mdash;the Abhishahas, the Shurasenas, the Shibis, the Vasatis, the Machellakas, the Lalitthyas, the Kekayas, the Madrakas, the Narayanas, the Gopalas and masses of Kambojas. They were revered as brave ones and had earlier been vanquished by Karna. With Bharadvaja’s son at the forefront, they rushed at Arjuna, ready to give up their lives. He was angry and consumed by grief on account of his son. He was like Death and the Destroyer. He was armoured and wonderful in fighting. He was ready to give up his life in that tumult. Like the leader of a herd of elephants, he was ready to devour those soldiers. He was a great archer and brave. He was a tiger among men and they sought to counter him. A tumultuous battle commenced and it made the body hair stand up. It was between the others who sought to fight and Arjuna. The bull among men advanced, wishing to kill Jayadratha. They united and countered him, like medicines against a disease that has surfaced.”’</p>

He tormented your soldiers, like a large number of diseases assailing the body. Horses were pierced. Standards were severed. Elephants and their riders were brought down. Umbrellas and bows were pierced. Chariots were deprived of their wheels. The soldiers were afflicted by arrows and were routed in every direction. This was the terrible battle and nothing could be distinguished. O king! In that battle, they fought each other with arrows and Arjuna made the standard-bearers tremble with his sharp arrows. He was always devoted to the truth. He was always truthful to his pledge.

We beheld the extraordinary fighting skills of Drona, the preceptor. Even though he was young and exerted himself, Arjuna could not pierce him back. The cloud that was Drona was like a mighty cloud that poured down thousands of torrents of rain in the form of a shower of arrows on the mountain that was Partha. O venerable one! Arjuna used the brahmastra to counter the shower of arrows. The spirited one countered all those arrows with his own arrows. Drona then struck the one on white horses with twenty-five arrows and struck Vasudeva on the chest and the arms with seventy swift arrows. The intelligent Partha laughed at this mass of arrows released by the preceptor. He released sharp arrows and countered him in battle. Those two,<a id="calibre_link-380" href="#calibre_link-973" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">36</sup></a> supreme among rathas, were thus wounded by Drona. The unassailable one was like a sun that <a id="calibre_link-2797" class="calibre2"></a>has arisen at the end of a yuga and they avoided him. They avoided the sharp arrows that were released from Drona’s bow.</p>

Maharatha Kritavarma took up another bow and swiftly struck him in the chest with five arrows. He again pierced Partha with five sharp arrows. Partha struck him between the breasts with nine arrows. On seeing that Kounteya was obstructed by the ratha Kritavarma, Varshneya thought that they should not waste time. At this, Krishna spoke to Partha. ‘Do not show mercy towards Kritavarma. Forget the relationship with him and crush and kill him.’<a id="calibre_link-384" href="#calibre_link-977" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">40</sup></a> Thereafter, Arjuna confounded Kritavarma with his arrows.

He picked up his bow and arrows and attacked the two Panchalas who were following Arjuna and guarding his chariot wheels. Kritavarma used his arrows to counter the two rathas. Bhoja used three arrows completely made out of iron to pierce Yudhamanyu and four for Uttamouja. They pierced him back with ten arrows each. They severed his standard <a id="calibre_link-2799" class="calibre2"></a>and his bow. Hardikya became senseless with anger and picked up another bow. He enveloped the two brave ones with arrows and deprived them of their bows. They grasped and readied other bows and struck Bhoja. Meanwhile, Bibhatsu penetrated the enemy’s army. But those two bulls among men endeavoured, they could not penetrate the formation of Dhritarashtra’s son, since the entry was barred by Kritavarma.</p>

Though the slayer of enemies was within reach of Kritavarma, he did not kill him. On seeing that he was advancing, the brave King Shrutayudha angrily attacked him, brandishing a giant bow. He pierced Partha with three arrows and Janardana with seventy. He struck Partha’s standard with an extremely sharp kshurapra arrow. At this, Arjuna was extremely enraged. He used ninety arrows with drooping tufts to strike him, like a giant elephant being struck with a goad. O king! But he could not tolerate Pandaveya’s valour and struck him with seventy-seven iron arrows. At this, Arjuna severed his bow and deprived him of his quiver. He angrily struck him on the chest with seven arrows with drooping tufts. The king was senseless with rage and picked up another bow. He struck Vasava’s son<a id="calibre_link-386" href="#calibre_link-979" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">42</sup></a> in the arms and the chest with nine arrows. But Arjuna, the destroyer of enemies, smiled at Shrutayudha. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! He afflicted him with thousands of arrows. The maharatha swiftly killed his horses and his charioteer. The immensely strong one then pierced him with seventy iron arrows. With his horses slain, King Shrutayudha abandoned that chariot. The brave King Shrutayudha was the son of Varuna. His mother was the great river Parnasha,<a id="calibre_link-387" href="#calibre_link-980" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">43</sup></a> with cool waters. In the battle, the brave one raised his club and rushed against Partha. For the sake of her son, his mother had spoken these words to Varuna. ‘In this world, let my son be unslayable by enemies.’ Pleased with her, Varuna had said, ‘For the sake of his welfare, I will grant him this boon. Because of this divine weapon, it won’t be possible <a id="calibre_link-2801" class="calibre2"></a>for your son to be killed. But it is impossible for any human to be immortal. O supreme among rivers! Everyone who has been born must certainly be mortal. Because of the power of this weapon, the enemies will always find him to be unassailable in battle. Dispel this fever from your mind.’ Having spoken these words, Varuna gave him the club, with the relevant mantras. Having obtained this, Shrutayudha became invincible in all the worlds. But the illustrious lord of the ocean again spoke these words. ‘This should never be released on someone who is not fighting. If that is done, it will descend on you.’ He used that slayer of enemies to strike Janardana.<a id="calibre_link-388" href="#calibre_link-981" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">44</sup></a> The valiant Krishna received it on his broad shoulders. Shouri did not tremble, like Mount Vindhya against the wind. This was like a badly performed act of magic that backfires. It returned and killed the brave and intolerant Shrutayudha, who was stationed there. Having slain the brave Shrutayudha, it fell down on the ground. Great sounds of lamentation arose among the assembled soldiers, when they saw that Shrutayudha, the scorcher of enemies, had been slain by his own weapon. O lord of men! This was because Keshava was a non-combatant and Shrutayudha had hurled the club at him. He was thus slain and destroyed, just as Varuna had said. All the archers saw him fall down on the ground. Thus was Parnasha’s beloved son brought down. He was as resplendent as a tree with many branches, shattered by a storm. On seeing that Shrutayudha, the scorcher of enemies, had been slain, all the soldiers and all the chiefs among the soldiers began to flee.</p>

In the battle, pierced by sharp arrows released from Gandiva, he pierced Arjuna back with ten arrows shafted with the feathers of herons. He again pierced Vasudeva with three and Partha with five. O venerable one! At this, Partha severed his bow and standard. <a id="calibre_link-2803" class="calibre2"></a>Pandava pierced him with two extremely sharp broad-headed arrows.

However, Partha’s valour was unthinkable. He used fourteen arrows shafted with heron feathers to pierce him, his horses, his standard, his bow and his charioteer. He used many other arrows to shatter his chariot. Though Sudakshina of Kamboja was valiant, his resolution had been rendered unsuccessful. With a broad and sharp arrow, Pandava pierced his heart. With his armour shattered, he trembled in his limbs. His crown and his armlets were dislodged. The brave one fell downwards, like a standard released from an implement. He was like a handsome and well-established karnikara tree on a mountain peak in the spring in the Himalayas, shattered by the force of the wind. The handsome Sudakshina of Kamboja was slain and lay down on the ground, though he deserved an expensive bed. His eyes were coppery red and his ears were adorned.

They were terrified and fled, like small animals before a tiger. Having returned again, they surrounded Partha from all sides. Wishing to defeat the enemy in battle, he was fighting <a id="calibre_link-2806" class="calibre2"></a>with the foes and killing them. Arrows were quickly released from Gandiva and descended on them. Dhananjaya brought down heads and arms. Without any gaps, the earth was strewn with fallen heads. Crows, vultures and wild crows flew around and seemed to form a shadowy canopy over the field of battle. On seeing that they were being routed, Shrutayu and Achyutayu became intolerant with rage and began to fight against Dhananjaya. They were strong, proud and brave, born in noble lineages and strong-armed. O great king! Desiring great fame, they swiftly showered down arrows from the left and from the right. For the sake of your son, those two archers wished to kill Arjuna. They angrily covered Arjuna with thousands of arrows with drooping tufts, like clouds filling a lake. The angry Shrutayu struck Dhananjaya, best among rathas, with a yellow and sharp javelin. Powerfully pierced by the enemy, the destroyer of enemies was overcome by supreme lack of consciousness in the battle, confounding Keshava also.

Severely pierced, Partha held onto the pole of the standard. O lord of the earth! A great sound, like the roar of lions, arose from all your soldiers, because they thought that Dhananjaya was dead. On seeing Partha bereft of his senses, Krishna was also extremely tormented and as his well-wisher, he comforted Dhananjaya with words of assurance.

Wounded by Partha’s arrows, elephants vomited blood. Thousands of them had their bodies mangled, with their riders and with those who followed them on foot. They shrieked as they fell down. Others fled in different directions. Many were greatly terrified and as those elephants fled, they crushed their own ranks. There were other fighting elephants that were kept separately and they were as virulent as poison.<a id="calibre_link-394" href="#calibre_link-987" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">50</sup></a> These went mad and behaved in the same way.</p>

There were Yavanas, Paradas, Shakas, Sunikas, Goyaniprabhas, mlecchas, armed Kalakalpas, Darvabhisaras, Daradas, Pundras and Bahlikas. There were hundreds and thousands of them and they formed a large force. They showered down weapons, but proved to be incapable. The arrows released by Dhananjaya enveloped all those soldiers, like a cloud of locusts in the sky. There were mlecchas with heads partly or completely shaved. Some had matted hair. Others were filthy in conduct, with malicious faces. Through the maya of his weapons, he killed hundreds of those assembled ones. Hundreds of those who lived in congregations were pierced by arrows.<a id="calibre_link-395" href="#calibre_link-988" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">51</sup></a> Those who lived in mountainous caverns were frightened in that battle and fled.

The bull among kshatriyas sent six thousand brave and supreme ones and a thousand other supreme kshatriyas to the world of the dead. As if decreed by destiny, thousands of elephants were pierced by the arrows. They lay down on the ground, like mountains shattered by thunder. Thus did Arjuna roam around and kill horses, rathas and elephants. He was like an elephant with rent temples crushing a forest of reeds. He was like a fire, aided by the wind, consuming a forest, with its many trees, lantanas and creepers and heaps of dense and dry grass. Your soldiers were like a forest and Krishna was like the wind. The angry Pandava Dhananjaya, with his rays of arrows, was like the fire. He made the seats of chariots bereft of them and made them lie down on the ground. With the bow in his hand, Dhananjaya seemed to dance around in that melee. His arrows were like the touch of the vajra and he covered the ground with blood. The angry Dhananjaya penetrated the army of the Bharatas.</p>

At this, Ambashtha’s eyes became red with anger. He grasped a club and attacked Keshava and maharatha Partha in that battle. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! The brave one laughed and raised his club. He obstructed the chariot with his club and struck Keshava. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! On seeing that Keshava had been struck with the <a id="calibre_link-2814" class="calibre2"></a>club, Arjuna, the destroyer of enemy heroes, became extremely angry with Ambashtha. In that battle, he used gold-tufted arrows to cover the supreme of rathas and his club, like clouds enveloping the rising sun. Partha then used other arrows to shatter the club of the great-souled one and it was extraordinary. On seeing that it had fallen down, he grasped another mighty club and used that to again repeatedly strike Arjuna and Vasudeva. Arjuna used two kshurapra arrows to slice down his arms, with the upraised club. He then used another arrow to slice down his head, which was like Indra’s pole. O king! Thus slain, he roared and fell down on the ground. It was like Indra’s standard, when it has been freed from the bonds that tie it to the implement. Partha was then surrounded on all sides by a dense array of chariots and hundreds of elephants and horses and disappeared, like the sun shrouded by clouds.”’</p>

Though you have obtained your livelihood from us, you have been engaged in bringing injury to us. I did not know you earlier. You are like a razor dipped in honey. If you had not granted me the boon that you would afflict the Pandavas, I would not have restrained the lord of Sindhu from returning to his own home. I displayed weak intelligence in depending on your assurance and your weapons. Having stupidly assured the lord of Sindhu, I have given him death. Even if a man enters Yama’s mouth, he may escape.

In the battle, the enraged King Bahlika fought against Droupadi’s maharatha sons and this was as beautiful as the mind battling against the five senses. They,<a id="calibre_link-426" href="#calibre_link-1019" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">82</sup></a> supreme among beings, fought fiercely and showered arrows in every direction, like the senses fighting for possession of the body. Your son, Duhshasana, struck Varshneya Satyaki with nine sharp arrows that had drooping tufts. Having been thus grievously struck by that great archer, the archer Satyaki, for whom truth was his valour, quickly lost his senses somewhat. But having regained his composure, Varshneya swiftly pierced your maharatha son with ten arrows that were shafted with the feathers of herons. O king! They pierced each other firmly with arrows and the wounded in the battle, were dazzling, like blossoming kimshukas. The angry Alambusa was afflicted by Kuntibhoja’s arrows, which found their mark. He was as beautiful as a flowering kimshuka. The rakshasa pierced Kuntibhoja with many iron arrows. At the forefront of your <a id="calibre_link-2842" class="calibre2"></a>army, he then roared loudly. Those two brave ones fought against each other in that battle. To all the beings, they seemed to be like Shakra and Jambha in ancient times.<a id="calibre_link-427" href="#calibre_link-1020" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">83</sup></a> O descendant of the Bharata lineage! The sons of Madri were angry and violent against Shakuni in the battle, since he had caused the enmity earlier. In the battle, they afflicted him with arrows.</p>

He was unable to exhibit his valour in battle and did not know what to do. On seeing that he was retreating, Madri’s maharatha sons again showered down arrows on him, like clouds raining down on a large mountain. He was struck by many arrows with drooping tufts. Using his swift horses, Soubala fled towards Drona’s array. Ghatotkacha rushed against the brave rakshasa Alayudha. But in that battle, he used only a medium violence and force.<a id="calibre_link-431" href="#calibre_link-1024" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">87</sup></a> O great king! The wonderful battle between the two was like the battle that had taken place in earlier times between Rama and Ravana.

It was like the great battle that had taken place in earlier times between Shambara and the king of the immortals.<a id="calibre_link-432" href="#calibre_link-1025" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">88</sup></a> Your sons, Vivimshati, Chitrasena and Vikarna, were surrounded by a large army and fought against Bhimasena.”’</p>

The Kouravas were divided into three and the Pandavas rushed against them. Bhimasena rushed against the mighty-armed Jalasandha and Yudhishthira and his soldiers attacked Kritavarma in the battle. O great king! Dhrishtadyumna showered down arrows that were as dazzling as the rays of the sun and attacked Drona in the battle. A battle commenced between all the spirited archers, between the Kurus and the Somakas, who were angry with each other. There was the destruction of beings and it gave rise to great terror. The soldiers were engaged in duels and fought without any fear. The powerful Drona fought with the powerful son of Panchala. He<a id="calibre_link-433" href="#calibre_link-1026" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">89</sup></a> showered down a torrent of arrows and it was extraordinary.

There were also garments, ornaments, arms, standards, armour and weapons. They were golden and colourful and were smeared with blood. Thus smeared, they looked like masses of clouds, tinged with lightning. The arrows brought down elephants, horses and men in that battle. The maharathas released these from bows that were as long as palm trees. In that clash between the brave and great-souled ones, swords, shields, bows, heads and armour were strewn around. O great king! In every direction, in that supreme carnage, many headless torsos were seen to arise. O venerable one! Vultures, herons, wild crows, hawks, crows, jackals and large numbers of many other carnivorous beasts were seen. O king! They fed on the flesh and drank the blood. They dragged them<a id="calibre_link-435" href="#calibre_link-1028" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">91</sup></a> by the hair and got at the marrow in many ways. They tugged at the bodies and the severed limbs. Large numbers of heads of men, horses and elephants were there. The men were skilled in the use of weapons. They were trained in war and <a id="calibre_link-2847" class="calibre2"></a>were accomplished. They wielded arrows and desired victory in that battle. They fought fiercely there. In that battle, many on your side displayed many beautiful motions of fighting with swords, scimitars, javelins, spikes, spears, lances and battleaxes. There were those who raised clubs, maces and other weapons in their arms. Men angrily fought and killed each other with their bare arms. Rathas fought against rathas, horse-riders against horse-riders, elephants against supreme elephants and infantry against infantry. Some were excited and crazily attacked each other, as if they were roaming around in an arena.<a id="calibre_link-436" href="#calibre_link-1029" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">92</sup></a> They shrieked and killed each other in the battle.</p>

Those horses got mixed up in the battle and were as beautiful as clouds tinged with lightning. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! The brave Dhrishtadyumna saw that Drona was near. He discarded his bow and grasped a sword and a shield. Parshata, the destroyer of enemy heroes, wished to perform an extremely difficult feat. With great strength, he approached Drona’s chariot. He stationed himself on the middle of the yoke and sometimes on the joints of the yoke. He slew half of those horses and was honoured by the soldiers. With the sword in his hand, he roamed around amidst those red horses. Drona could not detect a weakness in him and it was extraordinary. He was like a hawk descending in the forest, in search of some flesh. Thus did he venture forth, wishing to kill Drona. Drona released a hundred arrows to cut off the shield, which was decorated with the mark of a hundred moons. He then severed the sword of Drupada’s son with ten arrows. The powerful one used sixty-four arrows to kill his horses. With two broad-headed arrows, he severed his standard and his umbrella and killed the charioteers who guarded his flanks.<a id="calibre_link-438" href="#calibre_link-1031" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">94</sup></a> He stretched his bow back to his ears, like the wielder <a id="calibre_link-2849" class="calibre2"></a>of the vajra releasing the vajra and swiftly affixed a supreme arrow that would have caused death. However, Satyaki severed that arrow with fourteen arrows. He rescued Dhrishtadyumna, as he was about to be devoured by the preceptor’s mouth. O venerable one! The lion among men had grasped him, like a deer grasped by a lion. But the bull among the Shini lineage freed Panchala from Drona. On seeing that Satyaki had rescued Panchala in that great battle, Drona swiftly shot twenty-six arrows at him. While Drona was devouring the Srinjayas, Shini’s grandson pierced him back in the chest with twenty-six sharp arrows. All the Panchala rathas were desirous of victory. They swiftly withdrew Dhristadyumna and resorted to Satvata, as he attacked Drona.”’</p>

In every direction, he seemed to leap up into the sky, or climb up mountains. He showered gold-tufted arrows and attacked Yuyudhana.

Drona was like an unassailable cloud and his horses seemed to have been urged on by the wind. Shini’s brave descendant, the destroyer of enemy cities, saw him descend. He was invincible in battle and laughingly told his charioteer, ‘This brahmana is cruel.

They possessed the speed of the wind and they swiftly advanced towards Drona. Those two brave ones fought against each other and everything was covered with a net of arrows, so that it became intolerable to others. There was a fearful darkness, without any gaps. Both Drona and Satvata were skilled in using their weapons swiftly. Those two lions among men were seen to shower down arrows incessantly. As the torrent of arrows showered down and struck each other, the sound that was heard was like the sound when Shakra releases his vajra. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! They were pierced by iron arrows and their forms looked like those of snakes which had been struck by venomous serpents. The extremely terrible sound of bowstrings and palms slapping was heard. It was like that of innumerable mountain tops shattered by thunder. The chariots, horses and charioteers of both looked beautiful. They were mangled by gold-tufted arrows and looked colourful. O lord of the earth! The iron arrows were bright and flew straight. As they descended, they looked as terrible as snakes that had shed their skins. Both their umbrellas were brought down. Both their standards were also brought down. The limbs of both flowed with blood. But they were both dazzling, as they wished for victory. With blood flowing from their limbs, they looked like exuding elephants. They struck each other with arrows that were fatal.</p>

<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2855">‘“O great king! The sounds of delighted roars, mixed with the sound of conch shells and drums, ceased, because no one else made any sound. The soldiers in the arrays became silent and the warriors stopped the fighting. Everyone was curious to witness the duel between those two. Rathas, elephant-riders, horse-riders and infantry surrounded those two bulls among men, witnessing what was going on, with unblinking eyes. The arrays of elephants stood there, and so did the arrays of horses. There were divisions of chariots, stationed in counter-formation. They were colourful with pearls and coral. They were decorated with gems and gold. They were colourful with standards and ornaments and with golden armour. There were <em class="calibre4">vaijayanti</em> flags<a id="calibre_link-444" href="#calibre_link-1037" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">100</sup></a> and caparisons, seats and blankets. There were sparkling and sharp weapons on the horses. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! The frontal lobes of the elephants were decorated with gold and silver and there were garlands around their tusks.

The immensely strong ones exhibited the dexterity of their hands in using weapons. Drona and Satyaki pierced each other with their arrows. In the battle, Dasharha<a id="calibre_link-447" href="#calibre_link-1040" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">103</sup></a> used swift and extremely firm arrows to sever Drona’s arrows and then severed the immensely radiant one’s bow too. But in the twinkling of an eye, Bharadvaja’s son grasped another bow. <a id="calibre_link-2857" class="calibre2"></a>However, as he strung it, Satyaki swiftly severed this too. Drona again grasped another bow and stood with it in his hand. As he repeatedly strung his bow, it was again severed with sharp arrows. O Indra among kings! In the battle, Drona witnessed Yuyudhana’s superhuman deed and thought about this in his mind. ‘This kind of strength of arms has been seen in Rama,<a id="calibre_link-448" href="#calibre_link-1041" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">104</sup></a> Kartavirya, Dhananjaya and Bhishma, the tiger among men. This is now seen in the supreme one among the Satvata lineage.’ Having thought about this in his mind, Drona honoured his valour. The supreme among brahmanas beheld a dexterity that was like Vasava’s. The foremost among those who was knowledgeable about weapons was gratified, and so were the gods, with Vasava. O lord of the earth! That kind of dexterity of hand and swiftness of action, as shown by Yuyudhana, had not been seen earlier by the gods, the gandharvas and the masses of siddhas and charanas, though they had known what Drona was capable of doing. Drona, the destroyer of kshatriyas, then picked up another bow. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! The foremost among those who knew about weapons released weapons in the battle. However, Satyaki repulsed them with the maya of his own weapons. He destroyed them with his sharp arrows and it was extraordinary. His superhuman deeds were witnessed in the battle and no one else was capable of these. This was the outcome of yoga. Those on your side, who were knowledgeable about yoga, honoured this. Whatever weapon Drona used, Satyaki used that as well. Therefore, the preceptor, the scorcher of enemies, fought carefully. O great king! The one who knew about the science of fighting became enraged. To slay Yuyudhana, he invoked a divine weapon. On seeing the extremely terrible agneya weapon, the destroyer of enemies, the great archer, released the divine varuna weapon. On beholding that both of them had resorted to the use of divine weapons, a great sound of lamentation arose. There were woes in the sky, from the beings who had taken to the sky. However, the varuna and agneya weapons were pacified when they confronted each other’s arrows.</p>

With Dhrishtadyumna at the forefront, Virata, the Kekayas, the Matsyas and the soldiers from the Shalveyas quickly advanced against Drona. With Duhshasana at the forefront, thousands of princes advanced towards Drona, who was surrounded by the enemy. O king! A battle started between them and your archers. The world was covered with dust and enveloped in that net of arrows. Everyone was anxious and nothing could be distinguished. The soldiers were covered in dust.

With his sharp arrows, Kounteya created a path that was just sufficient for the chariot. And in this way, Janardana followed along that path. O lord of the earth! Wherever the great-souled Pandava’s chariot advanced, your soldiers were shattered and routed there. The valiant Dasharha displayed his skills in driving the chariot.

In that battle, together with the birds,<a id="calibre_link-452" href="#calibre_link-1045" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">108</sup></a> they drank the blood of beings. As he was stationed on his chariot, Arjuna shot his arrows at a distance of one krosha. Though the chariot advanced one krosha ahead, those arrows killed the enemy. Hrishikesha advanced and caused the entire universe to marvel. The well-trained horses possessed a speed like that of Tarkshya<a id="calibre_link-453" href="#calibre_link-1046" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">109</sup></a> or the wind. O lord of the earth! It advanced with a speed that the sun’s chariot, or that of Indra, Rudra or Vaishravana, could not muster. O king! Never had anyone’s chariot moved that fast in a battle, as that of Arjuna, as fast as mind or desire. O king! O descendant of the Bharata lineage! In the battle, Keshava, the destroyer of enemy heroes, urged the swift horses and penetrated into the midst of the soldiers.</p>

O king! Meanwhile, the two brave brothers from Avanti saw that Pandava’s horses were tired and suddenly attacked him. They pierced Arjuna with sixty-four arrows, Janardana with seventy and the horses with one hundred and were delighted. O great king! In that battle, Arjuna became angry. He knew about the inner organs and used nine arrows with drooping tufts to strike them in the inner organs. At this, the two of them<a id="calibre_link-455" href="#calibre_link-1048" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">111</sup></a> became wrathful. They enveloped Bibhatsu and Keshava with a torrent of arrows and roared like lions. In the battle, the one with the white horses then used two broad-headed arrows to sever their colourful bows and swiftly sliced down their standards, which were bright as gold. O king! In that encounter, they then grasped other bows and, extremely angry, began <a id="calibre_link-2864" class="calibre2"></a>to oppress Pandava with their arrows. At this, Dhananjaya, Pandu’s son, became wrathful. He used a couple of arrows to quickly sever their bows again. He then swiftly used other arrows that were gold-tufted and had been sharpened on stone. With these, he killed their horses, the two foot soldiers who guarded them and their parshni charioteers. With a kshurapra arrow, he severed the eldest one’s<a id="calibre_link-456" href="#calibre_link-1049" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">112</sup></a> head from his body. Slain, he fell down on the ground, like a tree that has been destroyed by a storm. On seeing that Vinda had been killed, the powerful Anuvinda abandoned his chariot, with the horses having also been slain. The immensely strong one grasped a club. In the battle, remembering that his brother had been killed, he attacked. The maharatha was foremost among those who fought with the club and seemed to be dancing around with his club. The angry Anuvinda struck Madhusudana on the forehead with the club. But though he was thus struck, he did not tremble and was like Mount Mainaka. At this, Arjuna used six arrows to slice off his neck, his two legs, his two arms and his head. Thus severed, they fell down, like hills. O king! On seeing that those two had been killed, their followers were filled with rage and angrily attacked, releasing hundreds of arrows. O bull among the Bharata lineage! But Arjuna quickly killed them with his arrows. He roamed around, like a consuming forest fire at the end of winter.</p>

On seeing him, the Kurus were frightened. O bull among the Bharata lineage! But they recovered and cheerfully attacked Partha from all directions. They knew that he was tired and they also knew that Saindhava was far away. They roared loudly like lions and surrounded him from all directions. On seeing that they were so enraged, Arjuna, bull among men, smiled. He softly spoke these words to Dasharha. ‘Our horses are oppressed by arrows and are exhausted. Saindhava is at a distance. What do you think is the best course of action now? What is your wish? O Krishna! Tell me exactly. You have always been the <a id="calibre_link-2866" class="calibre2"></a>wisest.

I think it is best to unyoke the horses. Remove their stakes.’ Having been thus addressed by Partha, Keshava replied, ‘O Partha! My view is identical to what you have expressed.’ Arjuna said, ‘O Keshava! I will repulse all the soldiers. You can properly perform the task that must be undertaken next.’ Dhananjaya got down from his chariot and stood there fearlessly. He held Gandiva bow and was stationed, as immobile as a mountain. The kshatriyas desired victory. On knowing that Dhananjaya was now stationed on the ground, they thought that this was a weakness. Roaring loudly, they attacked. They surrounded the solitary one with a large number of chariots. They stretched their bows and released arrows. They angrily displayed many different kinds of weapons. They covered Partha with arrows, like clouds enveloping the sun. The kshatriyas forcefully attacked that bull among the kshatriyas. He was a lion among rathas and those warriors attacked him, like crazy elephants attacking a lion. The great strength of Partha’s arms was then seen, since he angrily resisted a large number of soldiers surrounding him from every direction. The lord repulsed all the arms and weapons of the enemy. He quickly covered all of them with many arrows. O lord of the earth! The sky was dense with arrows. As a result of the friction, a giant fire with flames was ignited. The great archers sighed deeply and were covered with blood. Horses and elephants were shattered and roared in distress in all the directions. Desiring victory in the battle, those brave ones were angry and many of them wrathfully attacked the solitary one.

The chariots were like waves <a id="calibre_link-2867" class="calibre2"></a>on the ocean. The limbs of elephants were like mountains.

Arrows were the bamboos there. Arrows were the pillars and it was covered with arrows. It was extraordinary.

Though Kounteya fought on foot, the bulls among men who fought against him could not counter him and it was wonderful. Large numbers of chariots and many elephants and horses descended on him.

The valiant Partha received those nets of arrows, clubs and lances, like the ocean receiving rivers.

They generated great fear in us.’<a id="calibre_link-460" href="#calibre_link-1053" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">116</sup></a> O descendant of the Bharata lineage! Hrishikesha began to smile, as if he was amidst women,<a id="calibre_link-461" href="#calibre_link-1054" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">117</sup></a> after Arjuna had crated a pavilion made out of arrows in that field of battle. O lord of the earth! While all the soldiers on your side looked on, the lotus-eyed one led the horses inside. Krishna was skilled in all acts connected with horses. He removed all their exhaustion, pain, trembling, nausea and wounds. He removed the stakes with his hands and rubbed the horses down. Having comforted them in due fashion, he made them drink the water. Having obtained water and having bathed, they were free of pain and exhaustion. He again cheerfully yoked them to that supreme of chariots. Shouri, supreme among those who wield all weapons, then mounted the chariot, together with the immensely energetic Arjuna, and they departed swiftly.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2872">‘“On seeing that the supreme of chariots had been yoked to horses that had obtained water, the best among the Kuru army again became distressed. O king! They sighed, like snakes that had been defanged. They separately said, ‘Shame! Shame on us! While all the kshatriyas looked on, the armoured Partha and Krishna have passed us, on a single chariot. They have shattered our forces, like children playing with a toy. All the kings displayed their own valour. They shouted and made their best endeavours. But those scorchers of enemies have passed us, while we looked <a id="calibre_link-2873" class="calibre2"></a>on.’ On seeing that they had departed, other soldiers again said, ‘O Kouravas! Let all of us make haste, so that we can kill Krishna and Kiriti. Dasharha has yoked his chariot while all the archers have looked on. Repulsing us in the battle, he is proceeding towards Jayadratha.’ O king! There were some other lords of the earth who had seen a sight that had never before been seen in battle. On beholding that extraordinary wonder, they spoke to each other. ‘All these soldiers of King Dhritarashtra, the kshatriyas and the entire earth are in distress because of Duryodhana’s crime. They are confronting destruction. But the king<a id="calibre_link-462" href="#calibre_link-1055" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">118</sup></a> does not understand this.’ O descendant of the Bharata lineage! Thus did the kshatriyas speak there. Others said, ‘The king of Sindhu has gone to Yama’s abode. Let Dhritarashtra’s weak-sighted son decide on what should be done now.’ Meanwhile, the one with the sharp rays was on a downward course and Pandava headed towards Saindhava with greater speed. The horses were cheerful, now that they had drunk water. As the mighty-armed one, supreme among the wielders of all weapons, proceeded angrily, like Death, none of the warriors were capable of resisting him. Pandava, the scorcher of enemies, drove away those soldiers, like a lion agitating a mass of deer, for the sake of Saindhava. Dasharha goaded the horses and swiftly penetrated the array. He blew on Panchajanya, which possessed the complexion of cranes. The arrows shot earlier by Kounteya began to fall behind him, so fast did those horses, with the speed of the wind, proceed. The chariot roared like the clouds and the standard fluttered in the wind. On seeing that terrible standard, with the monkey on it, the rathas were distressed. The sun was covered everywhere with dust. The warriors were severely afflicted with arrows in that battle and no one was capable of glancing at the two Krishnas.<a id="calibre_link-463" href="#calibre_link-1056" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">119</sup></a> Dhananjaya wished to kill Jayadratha. Many enraged kings and many other kshatriyas surrounded him. In that great battle, when Partha, bull among men, stopped to remove the arrows, Duryodhana swiftly followed him.”’</p>

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-2876">‘Sanjaya said, “O king! On seeing that Vasudeva and Dhananjaya had penetrated, the kings on your side were immersed in fear. All of those great-souled ones were both angry and ashamed and were immobile. But having been urged by their spirits, they proceeded towards Dhananjaya. However, those who were driven by anger and intolerance and went to fight with Pandava did not return, like rivers heading towards the ocean. Those who were not virtuous fled, like atheists turning away from the Vedas. They committed sins and served the cause of hell. Those two bulls among men crossed over and freed themselves from that array of chariots and could be seen, like the sun and the moon freed from Rahu’s mouth.<a id="calibre_link-464" href="#calibre_link-1057" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">120</sup></a> They were like fish that had broken through a large net and were now devoid of fever. Thus did the two Krishnas look, after having broken through that net of soldiers. They freed themselves from Drona’s extremely impenetrable array, obstructed by weapons. Those great-souled ones were seen, like suns that had arisen at the end of a yuga. They were liberated from that obstruction of weapons and freed from that danger of weapons. Those great-souled ones could now be seen, creating obstructions for the enemy. It was as if they had been freed from the touch of a fire, or like fish freed from the mouth of a makara. Instead, those two agitated the soldiers, like a couple of makaras in the ocean. When they were stationed inside Drona’s array, those on your side and your sons had held the view that they would not be able to cross beyond Drona. O great king! On seeing that those two immensely radiant ones had passed beyond Drona’s array, they were no longer assured about the king of Sindhu remaining alive. O king! O lord! Earlier, your sons had possessed the strong hope that the two Krishnas would not be able to free themselves from Drona and Hardikya. O great king! But negating those hopes, those two scorchers of enemies passed beyond Drona’s array and Bhoja’s <a id="calibre_link-2877" class="calibre2"></a>impenetrable array. Having crossed, they were seen to be like blazing fires. Everyone was driven to despair and was certain that the king of Sindhu would no longer remain alive.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2878">‘“Krishna and Dhananjaya began to fearlessly converse among themselves about Jayadratha’s slaying, thus increasing the terror of the enemy. ‘He has been placed in the midst of six maharathas from the side of Dhritarashtra. But once he is seen, Saindhava will not escape us. Even if he is protected in the battle by Shakra and the masses of gods, I will still kill him.’ This is what he<a id="calibre_link-465" href="#calibre_link-1058" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">121</sup></a> told Krishna. Thus did the two mighty-armed Krishnas converse with each other, while looking for the king of Sindhu. Your sons heard this. They were like two thirsty elephants that had passed through a desert and were now assured after having drunk water. Those two scorchers of enemies seemed to have crossed over mountains infested by tigers, lions and elephants. Those mighty-armed ones seemed to have overcome death and disease. On seeing that those two had been freed, all those on your side shrieked and thought that the complexion on their faces<a id="calibre_link-466" href="#calibre_link-1059" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">122</sup></a> was terrible. They had been freed from Drona, who was like a virulent serpent, or as if from a blazing fire, and also from the other kings. They were as radiant as two suns. Those two scorchers of enemies had been freed from Drona’s array, which was like an ocean. They were seen to be extremely delighted, like those who had crossed a sea. They had been freed from a great shower of weapons, protected by Drona and Hardikya. They were seen to be blazing in that battle, like Indra or Agni. Because of the sharp arrows of Bharadvaja’s son, there was blood on the two Krishnas and they were as beautiful as mountains with karnikara trees. They had crossed over a lake in which Drona was the crocodile, lances were virulent serpents, iron arrows were makaras and kshatriyas were the deep water. They had been freed from the cloud that was Drona’s weapons, where thunder was the twang of bowstrings and the slapping of palms and clubs and swords were the lightning. They were <a id="calibre_link-2879" class="calibre2"></a>like the sun and the moon, freed of darkness. With their arms, they had swum across the six rivers that head to the ocean,<a id="calibre_link-467" href="#calibre_link-1060" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">123</sup></a> at the end of the summer, when the waters are overflowing and are also infested with giant crocodiles. The two Krishnas were great archers and their renown was famous in the world. But all the beings were astounded at their having withstood the strength of Drona’s weapons.</p>

They looked like two tigers who wished to descend on <em class="calibre4">ruru</em> deer. O great king! Such was the complexion on their faces that all your warriors thought that Jayadratha had already been slain. The mighty-armed Krishna and Pandava were together and their eyes were coppery red. They were delighted on seeing the king of Sindhu and roared repeatedly. The resplendence of Shouri with the reins and Partha with the bow was like that of the sun or the fire. They were delighted at having been freed from Drona’s array and at having seen that Saindhava was nearby, like two hawks at the sight of meat. On seeing that Saindhava was present nearby, they were like two hawks at the sight of meat. They descended, swiftly, angrily and suddenly.</p>

There were also those, like fires, who had been assigned to protect the king <a id="calibre_link-2882" class="calibre2"></a>of Sindhu. In that battle, they were also delighted to see your son.

The great archer can shoot up to a great distance. He is skilled in the use of weapons and is invincible in battle. He is firm in wielding weapons and is colourful in fighting. Dhritrarashtra’s son is extremely strong. He has been reared in great happiness, but is honoured by the maharathas. O Partha! He has always been accomplished, but he has always hated the Pandavas. O unblemished one! Therefore, I think that the time has come for you to fight with him. Like the stake in a gambling match, on him rests victory, or its reverse. O Partha! Release the venom of your anger here, which you have bottled up for a long time. This maharatha is the main source of the injury to the Pandavas. He is now within striking distance. See that you are successful. This king desires the kingdom. That is why he has come to fight with you. It is through good fortune that he has now arrived within the reach of your arrows. O Dhananjaya! Act so that he is deprived of his life. He is intoxicated and deluded because of his prosperity. He has never suffered from unhappiness. O bull among men! Nor does he know your valour in battle. O Partha! There is no one in the three worlds, gods, asuras or men, who can withstand you and vanquish you in battle, not to speak of Suyodhana alone. O Partha! It is through good fortune that he has come near your chariot. O mighty-armed one! Kill him, like Purandara against Vritra. O unblemished one! This powerful one has always sought to cause you injury. Through deceit, he cheated Dharmaraja in the gambling match. O one who grants honours! He has performed many <a id="calibre_link-2885" class="calibre2"></a>extremely cruel deeds towards him. Fight with this evil-minded one. You have never set your mind on evil. You have always been noble. This inferior man has been addicted to kama. O Partha! Set your mind on fighting nobly and without reflecting on it, kill him. O Pandava! He deceitfully robbed the kingdom and sent you on an exile to the forest. He caused oppression to Krishna.<a id="calibre_link-470" href="#calibre_link-1063" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">126</sup></a> Remember those in your heart and act valorously.

O Partha! Therefore, in this battle, kill Dhritarashtra’s son, the wretch of the lineage, just as in earlier times, in the battle between the gods and the asuras, Indra killed Jambha. If you kill him, the soldiers<a id="calibre_link-471" href="#calibre_link-1064" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">127</sup></a> will be without a protector and you can penetrate them.

Exhibiting my valour in fighting, I will slice off his head in the battle. O Madhava! Though she did not deserve it, he caused oppression to Krishna. She was dragged by the hair. Will I now be successful in avenging this?’ The two Krishnas talked to each other in this way. Borne on the best of white horses, they urged them in the battle, looking for the wicked one. O bull among the Bharata lineage! O venerable one! Having approached them, your son was not the least bit frightened, though there was reason for great fear. At this, all the kshatriyas on your side honoured him, because he advanced against Arjuna and Hrishikesha, desiring to repulse them. O lord of the <a id="calibre_link-2887" class="calibre2"></a>earth! On seeing the king in that battle, a great sound arose from all the soldiers on your side. As that great and terrible sound arose, your son countered and checked them.

Afflicted with fear, they exclaimed, ‘The king has been slain. The king has been slain.’ On hearing the roars of the men, Duryodhana said, ‘Dispel your fears. I will send the two Krishnas to the land of the dead.’ Having spoken thus to all the soldiers, the king expected to be victorious. He angrily addressed Partha and spoke these words. ‘O Partha! If you have actually been born from Pandu, quickly show me your weapons, divine and human. Show me your strength and your valour, and also that of Keshava. Act swiftly against me and show me your manliness. They have spoken about deeds you have done, but we have not seen them. They have been regarded as deeds of valour. Show them to me.’”’</p>

Partha quickly struck him, without being distracted, with fourteen arrows that had been sharpened on stone and were colourfully tufted. But those were neutralized by the armour. On seeing that those were unsuccessful, he<a id="calibre_link-475" href="#calibre_link-1068" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">131</sup></a> again struck him with fourteen sharp arrows. But these were also neutralized by the armour. On seeing that twenty-eight of his arrows had become unsuccessful, Krishna, the destroyer of enemy heroes, spoke these words to Arjuna. ‘I have never seen anything like this before. It is as if boulders have begun to move. O Partha! Arrows shot by you are bcoming unsuccessful. O bull among the Bharata lineage! Has Gandiva lost its life? Is the grasp of your fist and the strength of your arms not what it used to be earlier? Is this not the time for your final encounter with your enemy? Tell me. I am asking you. O Partha! In the battle, I am amazed at seeing that all your arrows are unsuccessful and are falling down in front of Duryodhana’s chariot. They are as terrible as the vajra or thunder. They penetrate the bodies of enemies. But those arrows are becoming unsuccessful. O Partha! What mockery is this now!’</p>

It is my view that Dhritarashtra’s son has sought refuge with Drona and he has fastened this weapon, so that the weapons are unsuccessful. O Krishna! This armour possesses the essence of the three worlds. Drona alone knows this. And I have learnt it from that excellent one. My arrows are incapable of penetrating this armour. O Govinda! Maghavan himself cannot shatter it with his vajra. O Krishna! Knowing this, why are you trying to confuse me? O Keshava! You know everything that goes on in the three worlds. You know everything about what will happen in the future. O Madhusudana! No one else knows it as well as you do. O Krishna! This Duryodhana has been prepared by Drona and is stationed fearlessly in this battle, having donned the armour. O Madhava! But he does not know something about the appropriate <a id="calibre_link-2892" class="calibre2"></a>course of action. He has only donned the armour like a woman. O Janardana! Witness the valour of my arms and my bow. I will defeat Kouravya, although he is protected by the armour. The lord of the gods gave this radiant armour to Angiras.

He told Keshava, ‘O Janardana! I am incapable of releasing this weapon a second time. If I do that, the weapon will kill those on our own side. But behold my power today.’ O king! Meanwhile, in that battle, Duryodhana pierced each of the two Krishnas with nine arrows that had drooping tufts and were like virulent serpents. In that encounter, he again showered down arrows on Krishna and Pandava. At this great shower of arrows, those on your side were delighted. They roared like lions and sounded their musical instruments. At this, Partha became enraged in that battle and licked the corners of his mouth. He did not see any part of the body that was not protected by the armour. He released some well-directed and sharp arrows that were like death. These killed his<a id="calibre_link-478" href="#calibre_link-1071" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">134</sup></a> horses and the two charioteers who guarded his flanks.<a id="calibre_link-479" href="#calibre_link-1072" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">135</sup></a> The valiant Savyasachi severed his colourful bow, the leather guards on his hands and shattered his chariot into fragments.

Keshava powerfully blew a loud note on Panchajanya, his eyelashes covered with dust and his face sweating profusely. At the roar of the conch shell and the sound of the bow, the men, whether they were spirited or dispirited, fell down on the ground. Arjuna’s chariot was freed from the melee, like a cloud driven by the wind. Those who were protecting Jayadratha, and their followers, became disturbed. The ones who were protecting Saindhava suddenly saw Partha. They roared loudly, in many ways, and made the earth tremble. The sound of their arrows mixed with other fierce sounds and the blare of conch shells. Those great-souled ones roared like lions. On hearing the terrible noise raised by those on your side, Vasudeva and Dhananjaya blew on their conch shells. O lord of the earth!

He brought down hundreds of sharp arrows and struck them, like a mighty storm shredding clouds.”’</p>

Because of your crimes, many men and many warriors were killed. They had been summoned from many directions, with horses, chariots and elephants. With Duryodhana at the forefront, there were these on one side and that bull among Pandus on the other. They roared at each other and the encounter began. Kounteya had Krishna as his charioteer and performed supreme and extraordinary deeds. Fearlessly, the single one advanced against the many.

A tumultuous and terrible battle commenced between the Panchalas and the Kurus and it was like that between the gods and the asuras. With the Pandavas, all the Panchalas reached Drona’s chariot.

He was swiftly countered by the immensely illustrious Kshemadhurti, who showered hundreds and thousands of sharp arrows. Dhrishtaketu, bull among the Chedis and possessing great strength, quickly attacked Drona, like the great Indra against Shambara. On seeing him suddenly descend, like death with a gaping mouth, Viradhanva, the great archer, quickly countered him. O great <a id="calibre_link-2913" class="calibre2"></a>king! Yudhishthira was stationed there, desiring victory, and he and his soldiers were repulsed by the valiant Drona. Nakula was skilled in battle and was valiant. O lord!

Vyaghradatta used extremely sharp and pointed arrows to repeatedly make Satyaki, tiger among men, tremble. Droupadi’s sons, tigers among men, angrily released supreme arrows.

At this, Drona became angry and struck the illustrious Kounteya, foremost among the Bharata lineage, between the breasts with twenty-five arrows. While all the archers looked on, Drona again struck him, his horses, his charioteer and his standard with twenty arrows. However, Pandava, with dharma in his soul, showed the dexterity of his hands and countered Drona’s arrows with a shower of arrows of his own. The archer Drona became extremely enraged in that battle. He suddenly severed the bow of the great-souled Dharmaraja. Having severed the bow, the maharatha swiftly covered him everywhere with many thousands of arrows. All those there saw that King Yudhishthira had been rendered invisible because of the arrows of Bharadvaja’s son and thought that he had been killed. Some others thought that he had run away. O Indra among kings! They said, ‘The king has been slain by the illustrious brahmana.’ Dharmaraja Yudhishthira thus confronted a great hardship. He cast aside the bow that had been severed by Bharadvaja’s son in the battle and grasped another divine bow that was capable of bearing a great burden and was more forceful. In that encounter, the brave one sliced down all <a id="calibre_link-2915" class="calibre2"></a>the thousands of arrows that had been released by Drona and it was extraordinary. Having severed the arrows, the king’s eyes became red with rage. In that battle, he grasped a lance that was capable of shattering the mountains. It was extremely terrible and fierce. It possessed a golden handle and was decorated with eight bells. The extremely powerful one roared cheerfully and hurled it. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! All the beings screamed in terror. On seeing the lance raised by Dharmaraja in that battle, all the beings suddenly exclaimed, ‘May all be well with Drona.’ Hurled from the king’s arms, it was like a snake that had cast off its skin. It blazed in the sky and in the directions and the sub-directions. It was like a she-serpent with a flaming mouth and it was as if Drona confronted death. O lord of the earth! On seeing it suddenly descend, Drona, supreme among those who knew about weapons, released the brahmastra. That weapon reduced the terrible-looking lance to ashes and then quickly advanced towards the chariot of the illustrious Pandava. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! When Drona’s weapon advanced, the immensely wise King Yudhishthira used a brahmastra to pacify it. In that battle, he then pierced Drona with five arrows with drooping tufts and used a sharp kshurapra arrow to severe his great bow. O venerable one! Drona, the destroyer of kshatriyas, cast aside the severed bow and suddenly hurled a club at Dharma’s son. On seeing that the club was powerfully descending, Yudhishthira, the scorcher of enemies, became angry and grasped a club. Those two clubs were powerfully hurled towards each other. They countered each other and emitted sparks because of the collision. They then fell down on the ground. O venerable one! Drona became extremely angry with Dharmaraja. He used four extremely sharp and supreme arrows to kill his horses. With another arrow, he severed his bow, which was like Indra’s standard. He severed Pandava’s standard and struck him with three arrows. With the horse slain, Yudhishthira quickly descended from the chariot. O bull among the Bharata lineage! The king stood there, with his arms raised and without any weapons. O lord! On seeing that he was without a chariot, and specifically without any weapons, Drona confounded the enemy and all the <a id="calibre_link-2916" class="calibre2"></a>soldiers. Displaying the dexterity of his hands, the one who was firm in his vows released large numbers of sharp arrows and advanced against the king, like an angry lion towards a deer.<a id="calibre_link-496" href="#calibre_link-1089" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">152</sup></a> On seeing that Drona, the destroyer of enemies, was advancing, sudden sounds of lamentation arose from the assembled Pandavas.

He used a yellow, sharp and broad-headed arrow to sever the bow of the great-souled Kekaya. Having severed his bow, he then used an arrow with drooping tufts to quickly pierce that supreme of archers in the chest. Brihatkshatra laughed and took up another bow. He deprived maharatha Kshemadhurti of his horses, charioteer and standard.

Those two spirited ones clashed against each other and seemed to possess arrows as their teeth. Wishing to kill each other, they struck each other with many thousand arrows. Those two tigers among men fought with each other, like two leaders of elephant herds, fierce and crazy, fighting with each other in a great forest. They were like angry tigers in a mountainous cavern. Wishing to kill each other, those immensely valorous ones fought. O lord of the earth! The battle was tumultuous and worth watching. Masses of siddhas and charanas witnessed the extraordinary wonder. O descendant of the Bharata lineage!

He grasped a large iron spear that possessed a golden handle. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! The immensely valorous one suddenly hurled this towards Viradhanva’s chariot. That spear was one that could kill heroes. Struck by it, he was severely hurt and with his heart shattered powerfully, fell down from the chariot onto the ground. O lord!

Severely and powerfully pierced, the immensely strong Indra among the rakshasas swiftly showered arrows that were gold-tufted and had been sharpened on stone. Those straight-tufted arrows penetrated the rakshasa,<a id="calibre_link-510" href="#calibre_link-1103" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">166</sup></a> like angry and immensely strong serpents penetrating a mountain top. O king! The Pandavas released sharp arrows from every direction. In that battle, Ghatotkacha, Hidimba’s son, desired the victory of the Pandavas and became anxious. He<a id="calibre_link-511" href="#calibre_link-1104" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">167</sup></a> was like a burnt mountain summit, or like a broken mass of collyrium.

His bones and ornaments were shattered. He was slain by the brave Ghatotkacha, like the twisted wood of a shala tree. On seeing that the traveller of the night had been killed, the Parthas were delighted. They roared like lions and waved their garments around. O bull among Bharatas! On seeing that Alambusa, terrible in form and the immensely strong Indra among the rakshasas had been killed and shattered like a mountain, the soldiers on your side uttered sounds of lamentation. <a id="calibre_link-2935" class="calibre2"></a>Curious people assembled to see the rakshasa’s body, which was lying on the ground, like a lump of charcoal. Having killed the supremely strong one, the rakshasa Ghatotkacha roared loudly, like Vasava after slaying Bala. Having performed this extremely difficult deed, Ghatotkacha was honoured by his fathers and their relatives. He was delighted that the enemy Alambusa had been slain, like a ripe <em class="calibre4">alambusa</em> fruit.<a id="calibre_link-515" href="#calibre_link-1108" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">171</sup></a> A great sound arose.<a id="calibre_link-516" href="#calibre_link-1109" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">172</sup></a> There was the sound of many different kinds of conch shells and the noise of arrows.

<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2938">‘Sanjaya replied, “O king! O immensely intelligent one! Listen. That encounter between Drona and the Pandavas, with Yuyudhana at the forefront, made the body hair stand up. O venerable one! On seeing that the army had been slaughtered by Yuyudhana, Drona himself advanced against Satyaki, for whom, truth was his valour. On seeing the maharatha who was Bharadvaja’s son suddenly descend, Satyaki pierced him with twenty-five <em class="calibre4">kshudraka</em> arrows. Drona was valorous in battle. Steadfastly and swiftly, he pierced Yuyudhana with five gold-tufted arrows that had been sharpened on stone. These drank up the blood of the enemy. O king! They penetrated the extremely firm armour and penetrated the earth, like sighing serpents. The long-armed one became angry, like an elephant urged with a goad. He pierced Drona with five hundred iron arrows that were <a id="calibre_link-2939" class="calibre2"></a>like fire. In that battle, Bharadvaja’s son was thus quickly pierced by Yuyudhana. Taking care, he pierced Satyaki with many arrows. The immensely strong and great archer became enraged. He afflicted Satvata with one hundred arrows with drooping tufts. O lord of the battle! For a short while, thus pierced in that battle by Bharadvaja’s son, Satyaki did not know what he should do. O king! On seeing Bharadvaja’s son release sharp arrows in that battle, Yuyudhana’s face looked distressed.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2940">‘“O lord of the earth! On seeing him in this state, your sons and the soldiers were delighted in their minds and repeatedly roared like lions. O king! O descendant of the Bharata lineage! On hearing this terrible roar and on seeing that Madhava was thus oppressed, Yudhishthira spoke to all the soldiers. ‘This brave Satyaki, the performer of truthful deeds, is supreme among the Vrishni lineage. He is being devoured in the battle by the brave one,<a id="calibre_link-517" href="#calibre_link-1110" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">173</sup></a> like the sun by Rahu. Go quickly to the spot where Satyaki is fighting.’ The lord of men spoke to Dhrishtadyumna from Panchala. ‘O Parshata! Attack Drona quickly. Why are you waiting? Can you not see the terrible danger that confronts us because of Drona? This Drona is a great archer. In the battle, he is playing with Yuyudhana, like a child with a bird that is tied to a string. Let the rathas go there, with Bhimasena at the forefront, and with all of you, towards Satyaki’s chariot. I will follow you, with my soldiers. Satyaki must be rescued now. He is within the jaws of death.’ Having spoken in this way, for Yuyudhana’s sake, the king and all the Pandava soldiers attacked Drona in that battle. O fortunate one! The Pandavas and all the Srinjayas raised a great roar there, as they fought with the single-handed Drona.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2941">‘“Those tigers among men united against the maharatha who was Bharadvaja’s son. They showered down sharp arrows, tufted with the feathers of herons, peacocks and hawks. However, Drona smiled and received all those brave ones himself, like receiving guests who have arrived, with seats and water. O king! Bharadvaja’s archer son tormented them with arrows, as if offering hospitality to guests who have arrived in a house. O lord! None of them were <a id="calibre_link-2942" class="calibre2"></a>capable of looking at Bharadvaja’s son. He was like the one with a thousand rays<a id="calibre_link-518" href="#calibre_link-1111" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">174</sup></a> when it is midday. Drona, supreme among those who wield weapons, scorched all those great archers with the storm of his arrows, like the sun with its rays. O king! The Pandavas and the Srinjayas were slaughtered in that battle and could see no protector, like an elephant that is immersed in mud. Drona was seen to release great arrows. They travelled in the sky and scorched all the directions, like the sun. Twenty-five Panchalas were killed by Drona. They were all famous as maharathas and had been honoured by Dhrishtadyumna. All the soldiers of the Pandus and the Panchalas saw Drona kill the best of brave warriors. O great king! Having killed one hundred Kekayas and routed them in all the directions, Drona was like Death with a gaping mouth. The mighty-armed Drona defeated hundreds and thousands of Panchalas, Srinjayas, Matsyas, Kekayas and Pandavas. They were pierced by Drona’s arrows and emitted a mighty sound, like the residents of a forest when the forest is consumed by a fire.<a id="calibre_link-519" href="#calibre_link-1112" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">175</sup></a> O king! The gods, the gandharvas and the ancestors said, ‘The Panchalas and the Pandavas are being driven away, with all their soldiers.’ When Drona thus slaughtered the Somakas in the encounter, no one dared to advance against him in the battle and no one could pierce him.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2943">‘“While that terrible destruction of the best of brave ones was going on, Partha<a id="calibre_link-520" href="#calibre_link-1113" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">176</sup></a> suddenly heard the sound of Panchajanya being blown. Blown by Vasudeva, that king of conch shells emitted a terrible blare. As the brave ones who were protecting Saindhava fought and the sons of Dhritarashtra roared and advanced towards Vijaya’s chariot,<a id="calibre_link-521" href="#calibre_link-1114" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">177</sup></a> the twang of Gandiva could not be heard in any direction. The Pandava king lost his senses and thought, ‘There is no doubt that Partha is not well, since the king of conch shells is blaring. The Kouravas are repeatedly roaring in delight.’ Having thought in <a id="calibre_link-2944" class="calibre2"></a>this way, Ajatashatru became anxious. Kounteya repeatedly spoke to Satvata, as if he was bereft of his senses and in a voice choking with tears.</p>

O Satyaki! Having considered all the warriors and having thought about it, I do not know of a greater well-wisher than you. You have always been affectionate towards us. You have always been devoted to us. It is my view that it is such a person who must be used in times of distress. Keshava has always been the refuge of the Pandavas. O Varshneya! You have also been like that and you are Krishna’s equal in valour. I will impose this burden on you and you should not refuse me. You should never act contrary to my intentions. He<a id="calibre_link-522" href="#calibre_link-1115" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">178</sup></a> is your brother and your friend.

O Shini’s descendant! One who gives up his body while fighting for his friends, is the equal of someone who has followed the proper rites and has donated the entire earth to brahmanas. We have heard of many kings who have ascended to heaven, after having followed the proper rites and having donated the entire earth to brahmanas. You have dharma in your soul. I am begging you, with my hands joined in salutation. O lord! Obtain fruits that are the equal of donating the earth, or something higher. There is one named Krishna who is always the dispeller of the fears of his friends and is ready to give up his life in battle.<a id="calibre_link-524" href="#calibre_link-1117" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">180</sup></a> O Satyaki!

There is no one other than you who can protect Vijaya in battle.

There is no one else who is his equal.” O son!<a id="calibre_link-530" href="#calibre_link-1123" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">186</sup></a> This is what Dhananjaya told me in Dvaitavana, when you were not present. He recounted your qualities in an assembly of noble ones. O Varshneya! You should not belie the expectations of Dhananjaya, Bhima, or me. While on the visit to the <em class="calibre4">tirtha</em>s, I had gone to Dvaraka. There, I had witnessed your devotion to Arjuna. O Shini’s descendant! While we were in Upaplavya, I did not witness in anyone else the affection of heart towards us that you possessed. You have been born in a noble lineage. You are devoted to us. You are your preceptor’s friend. O Madhava! You are a well-wisher. You are brave. You have been born in a noble lineage! O mighty-armed one! You are truthful. Show compassion towards Partha. O great archer! You should act in a deserving way. Suyodhana was armoured by Drona and has 
<a id="calibre_link-2947" class="calibre2"></a>suddenly gone towards Vijaya, where the Kourava maharathas had gone earlier. A great sound can be heard there. O Shini’s descendant! O Madhava! You should swiftly go there. If Drona advances against you, Bhimasena and we, and all our soldiers, will prepare ourselves and counter him. O Shini’s descendant! Behold. The soldiers of the Bharatas are being routed in the battle and as they are running away in the encounter, are uttering sounds of woe. It is like the ocean on the night of the new or full moon, driven by the force of the great wind. O son! The army of the sons of Dhritarashtra is being scattered by Savyasachi. Chariots, men and horses are quickly running away. The dust raised by the soldiers is spreading everywhere. The brave Phalguna, the destroyer of enemy heroes, has been surrounded by the brave Sindhus and the Souviras, who are fighting with nails and lances, and is severely afflicted. Without countering these forces, it is impossible to kill Jayadratha. All of them are prepared to give up their lives for Saindhava’s sake. There is a forest of arrows, spears and standards. There are large numbers of horses and elephants. Behold. The forces of the sons of Dhritarashtra are extremely difficult to assail. Hear the roar of the drums and the magnificent sound of conch shells. They are roaring like lions and there is the clatter of chariot wheels. Hear the sounds of the elephants and thousands of infantry. Listen. The earth is trembling because the riders are running. Saindhava’s array is in front of him and Drona’s array is at the rear. O tiger among men! There are so many that even Indra of the gods would be afflicted. He is immersed in an unlimited force and may lose his life. If he is killed in the battle, how can someone like me remain alive? Even if I were to obtain everything, life would be a hardship. Gudakesha is dark and young. Pandava is handsome. He possesses weapons. He is colourful in fighting. O son! The mighty-armed one has penetrated the army of the Bharatas at the time of sunrise. The day is almost over. O Varshneya! I do not know whether he is alive or not. This army of the Kurus is as large as an ocean. O son! The mighty-armed Bibhatsu has penetrated the army of the Bharatas alone and in a great battle, even the gods are incapable of resisting it. In today’s battle, my mind does not know what to do. Drona is violent in the battle and is oppressing my forces. O mighty-<a id="calibre_link-2948" class="calibre2"></a>armed one! You can see how that brahmana is roaming around. When several tasks present themselves, you are skilled in knowing which should be done. O Madhava! You should do what is the most important. You have always known which among several tasks should be performed first. In this battle, it is my view that Arjuna’s rescue is the immediate task. I do not sorrow over Dasharha. He is the protector and the lord of the universe. O son! O tiger among men! Even if the three worlds assemble together in battle, he is capable of withstanding them and defeating them, not to speak of this extremely weak force of the sons of Dhritarashtra. I tell you this truthfully. O Varshneya! But Arjuna is afflicted by many warriors. He may give up his life in the battle and that is the reason I am distressed. Therefore, follow in his footsteps. That is the way someone like you must tread at a time like this, especially when you are urged by someone like me. In a battle, among the foremost ones of the Vrishni lineage, two have been said to be atirathas. These are the mighty-armed Pradyumna and the illustrious Satvata.<a id="calibre_link-531" href="#calibre_link-1124" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">187</sup></a> You are equal to Narayana in weapons and equal to Samkarshana<a id="calibre_link-532" href="#calibre_link-1125" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">188</sup></a> in strength. O tiger among men! You are Dhananjaya’s equal in valour. You surpass Bhishma and Drona and all those who are skilled in fighting. In this world, the virtuous ones have spoken of you as a tiger among men. O Madhava! It has been said that there is nothing in the world that Satyaki cannot perform. O immensely strong one! Therefore, do what I am asking you to do. You should do what all the worlds and both the Parthas<a id="calibre_link-533" href="#calibre_link-1126" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">189</sup></a> are asking you to do. O mighty-armed one! You should not act contrary to those wishes. Give up your beloved life in this battle and roam around like a brave one. O Shini’s descendant! Those from the Dasharha lineage do not seek to protect their lives in battle. Staying in a battle without fighting and running away&mdash;those paths followed by cowards are not followed by those of the Dasharha lineage. O son! Arjuna is your preceptor. O bull among the Shini lineage! You have dharma in your soul. <a id="calibre_link-2949" class="calibre2"></a>Vasudeva is your senior and so is the intelligent Partha. Knowing of both these reasons,<a id="calibre_link-534" href="#calibre_link-1127" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">190</sup></a> I am addressing these words to you. Do not disregard my words. I am senior to your seniors and this is approved of by both Vasudeva and Arjuna. I am telling you this truthfully. Go to the spot where Dhananjaya is. O one for whom truth is valour! Follow these words of mine. O son! Penetrate the forces of the evil-minded son of Dhritarashtra. Having penetrated in the proper way, encounter those maharathas. O Satvata! In the battle, display the deeds that are worthy of your own self.’”’</p>

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-2951">‘Sanjaya said, “Those words were full of affection. They were sweet as honey. They were appropriate to the occasion. They were colourful and were addressed by Dharmaraja himself. On hearing those words, Satyaki, bull among the Shini lineage, spoke to Yudhishthira, foremost among the Bharata lineage. ‘O unblemished one! I have heard all your words. They are just, colourful, for Phalguna’s benefit and conducive to fame. O Indra among kings! At times like this, it is appropriate for you to command someone like me, who is in front of you.<a id="calibre_link-535" href="#calibre_link-1128" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">191</sup></a> It is exactly as you have said. I am just like Partha to you. For Dhananjaya’s sake, I have never sought to preserve my own life. Instructed by you, what will I not do in this great battle? O Indra among men! If instructed by you, I will fight the three worlds, with all the gods, asuras and men, not to speak of this extremely weak force of Duryodhana’s. O king! In this battle today, I will fight with them in every direction and conquer them. I am telling you this truthfully. I will be safe and will also reach Dhananjaya, who is also safe. O king! After Jayadratha has been killed, I will return before you again. O lord of men! However, I must tell you all the <a id="calibre_link-2952" class="calibre2"></a>words that were spoken by Vasudeva and the intelligent Phalguna. In the midst of all the soldiers and in Vasudeva’s hearing, Arjuna repeatedly and firmly instructed me. “O Madhava! Today, it is your task to protect the king earnestly. O noble one! Set your mind on fighting, until I have killed Jayadratha. O mighty-armed one! Having handed over the king to you and to maharatha Pradyumna, I am going undistractedly towards Jayadratha. You know that Drona is violent in battle and is regarded as the best. O Madhava! You also know about the pledge that he has taken in everyone’s hearing. Bharadvaja’s son has promised to capture Dharmaraja in battle. Drona is capable of afflicting Yudhishthira in the battle. Having entrused the task of protecting Dharmaraja, supreme among men, to you, I am going today to kill Saindhava. O Madhava! It is certain that I will return after killing Jayadratha. Ensure that Drona does not forcibly capture Dharmaraja in the battle. O Madhava! If the foremost among men is seized by Bharadvaja’s son, I will obtain no delight from having slain Saindhava. If the truthful Pandava, foremost among men, is seized, it is evident that we will have to go to the forest again. If the angry Drona captures Yudhishthira in the battle, it is evident that my victory will obtain no success. O mighty-armed one! O Madhava! For the sake of doing that which will bring me pleasure, and for the sake of victory and fame, protect the king in the battle.” You have been given to me as a trust by Savyasachi. O lord! You can see that there is always a fear because of Bharadvaja’s son. O mighty-armed one! O lord! In this battle, with the exception of Rukmini’s son,<a id="calibre_link-536" href="#calibre_link-1129" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">192</sup></a> I do not see anyone who is capable of withstanding him. In an encounter, I am regarded as a match for Bharadvaja’s intelligent son. I cannot act against that reputation or against the words of my preceptor. I cannot leave you. O lord of the earth! The preceptor<a id="calibre_link-537" href="#calibre_link-1130" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">193</sup></a> is light in hand and is clad in impenetrable armour. If he approaches you in the battle, he will toy with you, like a child with a bird. Had Krishna’s son<a id="calibre_link-538" href="#calibre_link-1131" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">194</sup></a> been here, with the makara on his banner and with the bow <a id="calibre_link-2953" class="calibre2"></a>in his hand, I would have handed you over to him and he would have protected you, like Arjuna. Protect yourself. Who will protect you when I am gone? When I go to Pandava, who will advance against Drona in the battle? O king! You should not have any fear on Arjuna’s account. The mighty-armed one does not suffer from any burden. There are warriors from the north, the Souviras, the Saindhavas and the Pouravas. There are other maharathas from the south, with Karna at the forefront. O king! They are famous as the best of rathas. But before an angry Arjuna, they do not amount to one of sixteen kalas.<a id="calibre_link-539" href="#calibre_link-1132" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">195</sup></a> O king!

O great king! Knowing this, banish any fear on Dhananjaya’s account. Where those two brave and great archers, the two Krishnas who have truth for their valour, exist, there is nothing that can stand against what they wish to do. They are divine. They are skilled in the use of weapons. They possess yoga. They are intolerant in battle. Think of the gratefulness and compassion of your brother. I will go towards Arjuna, as you have asked me to. O king! Drona is wonderful in the use of weapons in battle. Think about that. O king! The preceptor is extremely keen to capture you. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! I have to protect my pledge. I have to protect my truth. Who will protect you when I am gone? O Partha! Without handing over your protection to someone, how can I go towards Phalguna? O great king! I cannot leave you unprotected in this great battle. O Kouravya! How can I do that? I am telling you this truthfully. O supreme among those who possess intelligence! Use your intelligence to reflect on this in many ways. Use your intelligence to determine what is most beneficial. O king! Then instruct me accordingly.’</p>

As you have instructed, I will follow in his footsteps. There is nothing that I will not do for your sake. O supreme among men! The words of my preceptor are special. But your words are even more special for me. O bull among kings! Know that your brothers, Krishna and Vasudeva, are always engaged in doing what brings you pleasure and base themselves on your welfare. O lord! For Arjuna’s sake, I accept your words on my head. O supreme among men! I will penetrate these impenetrable soldiers. I will angrily pass through Drona’s array, like a fish through the ocean. O king! I will go to the spot where King Jayadratha is. He is stationed in the assembly of soldiers there, frightened of Pandava. He is protected by the best of rathas there&mdash;Drona’s son, Karna, Kripa and the others. O lord of the earth! I think that the spot where Partha is, prepared to slay Jayadratha, is three yojanas from here. But though he has advanced three yojanas, I will follow in his footsteps. O king! Firm in my resolution, I will remain there until he has killed Jayadratha. Instructed by his superiors, which man does not fight, not to speak of someone like me? O king! I have been commanded by you. O lord! I know the spot to which I have to go. This ocean of soldiers is full of iron rods, spears, clubs, lances, swords, shields, javelins, arrows and the best of weapons, but I will agitate it. You can see that there is an array of elephants, with one thousand of them. They have been born in the lineage known as Anjana<a id="calibre_link-545" href="#calibre_link-1138" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">201</sup></a> and are valorous. They are mounted by many mlecchas, who are armed and find delight in battle. O king! These elephants <a id="calibre_link-2959" class="calibre2"></a>have the complexion of clouds and are exuding like clouds.<a id="calibre_link-546" href="#calibre_link-1139" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">202</sup></a> If they are urged by the elephant-riders, they never retreat. O king! They cannot be vanquished until they have been killed. O king! You can see the rathas. These maharathas are princes and have the name of Rukmarathas.<a id="calibre_link-547" href="#calibre_link-1140" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">203</sup></a> O lord of the earth! They are skilled in fighting on chariots and on elephants. They are supreme in knowledge of fighting and are skilled in fighting with their fists. They are accomplished in fighting with clubs and also skilled in fighting at close quarters.<a id="calibre_link-548" href="#calibre_link-1141" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">204</sup></a> They have swords as weapons and can attack with the sword and the shield. These brave ones are skilled in knowledge and seek to rival one another. O king! They always vanquish a large number of men in battle. O king! They were vanquished by Karna and follow Duhshasana. They were applauded by Vasudeva as supreme rathas. They always seek to do that which brings Karna pleasure and follow his instructions. O king! It is on his instructions that they retreated from their pursuit of the one with the white horses. They have no wounds and are not exhausted. They possess strong armour and bows. On the commands of Dhritarashtra’s son, they are certainly waiting for me. O Kourava! For the sake of bringing you pleasure, I will crush them in the battle. I will then follow Savyasachi’s footsteps. O king! There are seven hundred other elephants that you can see. They are armoured and are ridden by <em class="calibre4">kirata</em>s.<a id="calibre_link-549" href="#calibre_link-1142" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">205</sup></a> To protect his life, the king of the kiratas had earlier ornamented them and presented them to Savyasachi, together with many servants. O king! They have performed many hard deeds for you earlier. Behold the vagaries of time that they are now battling against you. These elephants are ridden by kiratas, who are invincible in battle. All of them are skilled in handling elephants and descended from Agni. Savyasachi defeated all of them in a battle earlier. They follow Duryodhana’s instructions and are carefully waiting for me now. O king! These <a id="calibre_link-2960" class="calibre2"></a>kiratas are invincible in battle, but I will shatter them with my arrows. I will follow Pandava, as he is engaged in Saindhava’s death. These other extremely great elephants have been born in Anjana’s lineage. They are both harsh and humble and their temples and mouths are exuding. Their armour is completely made out of gold and they are well ornamented. O king! In a battle, they succeed in accomplishing their objectives and are like Airavata. They hail from the northern mountains, and fierce <em class="calibre4">dasyu</em>s<a id="calibre_link-550" href="#calibre_link-1143" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">206</sup></a> are astride them. They are harsh and supreme warriors and their armour is made out of black iron. There are also those who have been born from cows and those who have been born from monkeys. There are others who have been born from other species and those who have been born as humans. That army, which seems to have the complexion of smoke from a distance, consists of mlecchas who reside in fortresses in the Himalayas. They are the performers of evil deeds. Duryodhana obtained them and this large number of elephants, together with Kripa, Somadatta’s son, Drona, supreme among rathas, the king of Sindhu and Karna. He disregards the Pandavas. Driven by destiny, he thinks himself to be successful. But those that I have named will be within the reach of my iron arrows. O Kounteya! They will not escape from me, even if they possess the speed of thought. He<a id="calibre_link-551" href="#calibre_link-1144" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">207</sup></a> has always drawn sustenance from the valour of others and honours them. But they will be afflicted by arrows, and destruction confronts them. O king! You can see the rathas with golden standards. They are difficult to resist and are famous by the name of Kambojas. They are brave and skilled in knowledge. They are devoted to the science of fighting. They desire each other’s welfare and have assembled firmly. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! These angry ones constitute one akshouhini for Dhritarashtra’s son. They are stationed for my sake and are protected by the brave ones among the Kurus. O great king! They are not distracted and have presented themselves before me. I will destroy them, like a fire against straw. O king! Therefore, let those who prepare chariots make my chariot ready and equip it with all <a id="calibre_link-2961" class="calibre2"></a>the implements, as has been decreed by those who prepare chariots. Let all the different weapons used in war be placed. But compared to what the instructors have said, let five times the number be placed on the chariot. I will have to clash against and kill the Kambojas, who are as angry as venomous serpents. They possess many weapons and fight with many different kinds of weapons. I will have to clash against the kiratas, who are skilled in striking and like poison. They have always been nurtured by King Duryodhana and have his welfare in mind. I will have to clash against the Shakas, who are like Shakra in their valour. They are as unassailable as the fire and blaze like fires. There are many other warriors, who are as difficult to resist as time. O king! I will clash against many such invincible ones in the battle. Therefore, let the best of horses again be yoked to my chariot. Let them be without exhaustion. Let them bear auspicious marks. Let them be groomed and watered.’</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2962">‘“The king arranged for all the equipment and all the implements to be placed on the chariot. There were many different kinds of weapons. Skilled men unyoked all the well-trained horses. They were given tasty water and fed. After this, they were fanned. When they had drank and bathed, they were adorned with golden garlands. Stakes were plucked out from the four horses. Those handsome and swift-coursing horses were dressed in golden harnesses. They were cheerful and well trained and were yoked to the chariot. The giant standard, with the mark of a lion with golden manes, was erected. Pennants decorated with gold, gems and colourful coral were fastened. There was an ornamented flag, with the complexion of a white cloud. There was an umbrella with a golden staff and there were many weapons. With many golden trappings, the horses were duly yoked to the chariot. Daruka’s<a id="calibre_link-552" href="#calibre_link-1145" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">208</sup></a> younger brother was the charioteer and was also his<a id="calibre_link-553" href="#calibre_link-1146" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">209</sup></a> beloved friend. Like Matali to Vasava, he came and reported that the chariot had been yoked. Having bathed, Satyaki, supreme among handsome ones, purified himself. He performed the auspicious ceremonies and gave away one thousand nishkas of gold <a id="calibre_link-2963" class="calibre2"></a>to <em class="calibre4">snataka</em>s.<a id="calibre_link-554" href="#calibre_link-1147" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">210</sup></a> They blessed him.

The brave one touched the brass and his joy increased.<a id="calibre_link-557" href="#calibre_link-1150" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">213</sup></a> His energy doubled and he blazed like a fire. The supreme of rathas slung the bow around his hips and picked up the arrows. He was armoured and ornamented and the brahmanas pronounced benedictions on him. Beautiful maidens honoured him by showering parched rice, fragrances and garlands on him. He joined his hands in salutation and touched Yudhishthira’s feet. He<a id="calibre_link-558" href="#calibre_link-1151" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">214</sup></a> inhaled the fragrance of his head. He then ascended the giant chariot. The horses were cheerful and well fed and were as fleet as the wind. They were from the Sindhu region and bore him on that victorious chariot. Satyaki’s limbs were full of cheer and he spoke to Bhima. ‘O Bhima! Protect the king. That is your supreme duty. I will pierce through this army, which has been ripened by time. I will proceed and it is your supreme duty to protect the king. O destroyer of enemies! You know my valour and I know yours. O Bhima! Return and let me accomplish my desired objective.’<a id="calibre_link-559" href="#calibre_link-1152" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">215</sup></a> Having been thus addressed, he<a id="calibre_link-560" href="#calibre_link-1153" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">216</sup></a> replied, ‘O Satyaki! Go and accomplish your objective. O supreme among men! I will perform the task of protecting the king.’ Having been thus addressed, Madhava said to Bhimasena. ‘O Partha! Go! Go swiftly. It is certain that victory will be mine, since you are obedient, affectionate and devoted to me today. O Bhima! That is what these auspicious portents are telling me. There is no doubt that the wicked Saindhava will be slain by the great-souled Pandava and that I will embrace the king who has dharma in his soul.’ Having thus addressed Bhima, the great-minded <a id="calibre_link-2964" class="calibre2"></a>one took his leave. He glanced towards your soldiers, like a tiger towards a mass of deer. O lord of men! On seeing his glances, your soldiers were extremely confounded and began to tremble. Thus did Satyaki suddenly descend on your soldiers. O king! On Dharmaraja’s instructions, he wished to see Arjuna.”’</p>

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-2966">‘Sanjaya said, “O great king! Wishing to fight, Yuyudhana advanced against your soldiers. Dharmaraja, surrounded by his own soldiers, advanced towards Drona’s chariot, wishing to follow Yuyudhana from the rear. The son of the king of Panchala<a id="calibre_link-561" href="#calibre_link-1154" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">217</sup></a> was indomitable in battle. In the midst of the army of the Pandavas, he and King Vasudana loudly shouted, ‘Come! Strike! Advance swiftly against the enemy, so that Satyaki, indomitable in battle, can pass through easily. Many maharathas will endeavour to vanquish him.’ Having said this, they descended forcefully on your army. ‘We will defeat those who advance against him.’<a id="calibre_link-562" href="#calibre_link-1155" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">218</sup></a> A great sound then arose from the direction of Yuyudhana’s chariot and this made your son’s forces tremble mightily. O great king! They were shattered into a hundred fragments by Satvata. Shini’s maharatha grandson shattered them and crushed seven brave and great archers who were stationed at the forefront of the army. They were terrified, crushed and routed by the long-armed one. On seeing that superhuman one, the brave ones fled from the field of battle. O venerable one! Chariots were shattered and seats on chariots broken. Wheels were shattered and umbrellas and standards brought down. O lord of the earth! There were flags, bumpers and golden helmets. There were arms smeared with sandalwood paste, with armlets. O supreme among men! The thighs of men were strewn around on the ground. They were like the trunks of elephants, or the tapering bodies of serpents. O descendant <a id="calibre_link-2967" class="calibre2"></a>of the Bharata lineage! There were handsome faces with earrings and eyes like bulls, with complexions like that of the moon. They fell down and made the earth look beautiful. There were many mangled elephants, lying down like mountains. They were wounded severely and were strewn around on the ground, like elephants. Their harnesses were made of gold and they were garlanded with strings of pearls. The colourful breast plates of the horses were beautiful. They were destroyed by the long-armed one and having lost their lives, fell down on the ground. Satvata slew diverse kinds of your soldiers. Having penetrated your soldiers, he violently drove that army away.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2968">“He then wished to proceed along the path that Dhananjaya had followed. But as Satyaki proceeded, he was obstructed by Drona. O venerable one! Yuyudhana confronted Bharadvaja’s son. But the angry one did not retreat, like the store of water on encountering the shoreline. In that battle, Drona repulsed maharatha Satyaki. He pierced him with five sharp arrows that penetrated the inner organs. O king! In that encounter, Satyaki pierced Drona with seven arrows that were gold-tufted, sharpened on stone and with the feathers of herons, peacocks and hawks. Drona struck his horses and the charioteer with six arrows. Maharatha Satyaki could not tolerate this on Drona’s part. Satyaki roared like a lion and pierced Drona with ten other arrows and yet again with another fourteen. Yuyudhana again pierced Drona with ten arrows, his charioteer with one and his four horses with four arrows. O venerable one! In that battle, he pierced his standard with an arrow. Drona swiftly enveloped his horses, his charioteer, his chariot and his standard with swift arrows, like flying locusts. Yuyudhana also fearlessly covered Drona with many swift arrows. Drona said, ‘Your preceptor<a id="calibre_link-563" href="#calibre_link-1156" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">219</sup></a> has abandoned the battle and departed like a coward. He was fighting me. But keeping me to the right, he has left. O Madhava! If you do not swiftly avoid me in this battle, like your preceptor did, and continue to fight with me, you will not escape with your life today.’ Satyaki replied, ‘I am following Dhananjaya’s footsteps on Dharmaraja’s instruction. O brahmana! Be fortunate. I am leaving. I do not wish to waste time.’ O king! Having <a id="calibre_link-2969" class="calibre2"></a>said this, Shini’s descendant abandoned the preceptor and proceeded quickly. He told the charioteer, ‘Drona will make every effort to restrain me. O charioteer! Take care in this battle. Listen to these supreme words of mine. Behold. There is the extremely resplendent army of the Avantis. Next to that, there is the extremely powerful army from the south. Next to that, there is the large army of the Bahlikas. Joined to the Bahlikas, there is the large force of Karna. O charioteer! These armies are different from one another, but are dependent on each other. They support each other and will not give up the field of battle. Cheerfully goad the horses into the space that is between them. O charioteer! Adopt a medium speed and take me there, where the Bahlikas can be seen, with many weapons raised in their arms and there are many from the south, with the son of the suta at the forefront. His army of elephants, horses and chariots can be seen in an array. They have been raised from many countries and are stationed in the midst of the infantry.’ He avoided the brahmana and spoke thus to his charioteer. ‘Pass through the gap, towards Karna’s extremely large and fierce army.’ Drona became angry at this and followed him, releasing many arrows. But the mighty-armed Yuyudhana left and did not return.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2970">‘“Satyaki struck Karna’s extremely large army with sharp arrows and penetrated into the limitless army of the Bharatas. When Yuyudhana penetrated and the soldiers began to run away, the intolerant Kritavarma repulsed Satyaki. As he was advancing, the valiant Satyaki quickly struck him with six arrows and killed his four horses with four arrows. Satyaki again used sixteen swift arrows with drooping tufts to pierce Kritavarma between the breasts. O great king! Having been thus afflicted by many arrows of great energy released by Satvata, Kritavarma could not tolerate this. O king! He affixed a vatsadanta arrow that was like a tongue of fire. He stretched his bow up to his ear and struck Satyaki in the chest. The gold-tufted arrow penetrated the armour on his body and passing through the body, penetrated the earth, drenched in blood. O king! Kritavarma knew about supreme weapons. He used many arrows to slice down his bow, with the arrows affixed to them. O king! In that battle, he pierced Satyaki, for whom truth was his valour. He <a id="calibre_link-2971" class="calibre2"></a>angrily struck him between the breasts with ten sharp arrows. With his bow shattered, Satyaki, supreme among strong ones, picked up a javelin and used this to strike Kritavarma’s right arm. The brave Satyaki then grasped another firm bow and quickly released hundreds and thousands of arrows. He enveloped Kritavarma and his chariot. With a broad-headed arrow, he sliced down the charioteer’s head. Having been slain, Hardikya’s charioteer fell down from the great chariot. When the charioteer was slain, the horses fled at great speed. Disturbed, Bhoja himself controlled the horses, with the bow in one hand. At this, the soldiers honoured him. In an instant, he urged those well-trained horses on. He did not suffer from any fear, but caused great terror among his enemies. However, Satyaki had gone on ahead and he<a id="calibre_link-564" href="#calibre_link-1157" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">220</sup></a> attacked Bhima.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2972">‘“O Indra among kings! Yuyudhana emerged from Drona’s army and swiftly advanced towards the great army of the Kambojas. He was countered there by many brave maharathas. O king! Though truth was Satyaki’s valour, he could not move at all. Having arranged his army, Drona entrusted the burden to Bhoja and followed Yuyudhana in the battle, wishing to fight with him. He followed Yuyudhana from the rear and the largest of the Pandu armies angrily began to resist him. Having encountered the chariot of Hardikya, who was supreme among rathas, the Panchalas, with Bhimasena at the forefront, lost their enterprise. O king! The brave Kritavarma repulsed them with his valour. Though they endeavoured, all of them lost their spirits. Fearlessly, Bhoja used his torrent of arrows to obstruct and afflict their mounts. In that battle, those brave ones were oppressed by Bhoja’s army. But desiring great fame, they remained stationed, like noble ones.”’</p>

They are mature<a id="calibre_link-565" href="#calibre_link-1158" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">221</sup></a> and are wonderful in form. The firmness and valour have been seen earlier. They are not aged, nor young. They are not thin, nor are they obese. They are agile and tall and all their limbs are free of disease. They are adorned with armour and have many kinds of weapons. They are accomplished in many kinds of knowledge connected with weapons. They know how to ascend on the shoulders,<a id="calibre_link-566" href="#calibre_link-1159" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">222</sup></a> advance and retreat. They are accomplished in striking, moving forward and back. They have been tested in many ways, on elephants, horses and chariots.

These are the foremost of advisers and many others who have performed the best of deeds. There are many kings who wish to do what is beneficial for us and protect them. They have voluntarily sided with us, with their forces and their followers. Our army is like a giant ocean, with flowing rivers merging into it from every direction. It possesses many chariots and horses. Though they are without wings, they are like birds. The large number of warriors constitutes the water. The fierce mounts are the waves. There are catapults, swords, maces, spears, lances, arrows and javelins that are like fish. There are standards and ornaments, decorated with bejewelled garments. The advancing mounts are like the force of the wind that agitates it.<a id="calibre_link-569" href="#calibre_link-1162" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">225</sup></a> Drona is the fathomless nether regions.

O Sanjaya! After Savyasachi penetrated my soldiers, so did Satvata, supreme among rathas. On seeing those two valiant ones fearlessly and spiritedly advance and on seeing the king of Sindhu within the reach of Gandiva’s arrows, what did the Kurus do, driven by destiny? When that terrible time arrived, what happened to them? O son! I think that the assembled Kouravas were devoured by death. Today, their valour in battle can no longer be seen. In the battle, Krishna and Pandava have penetrated, without being injured. O Sanjaya! There is no one who can resist them. There are many paid warriors and tested maharathas. Some have been paid due wages and others served with pleasant words. O son! There is no one among my soldiers who has not been served, without due cause. The devoted ones have all obtained due wages, in accordance with their deeds. O Sanjaya! There is no warrior in my army who has been paid less than what is his due. O son! There is no man who has not been paid. To the best of my capacity, they have been honoured with gifts, honours and seats. O son! My sons, kith and kin have also acted in the same way. But when they confronted Savyasachi in the battle, they have been vanquished. They have been supremely crushed by Shini’s descendant. Other than destiny, what can this be? O Sanjaya! Those who are the protectors and those who are being protected are following the same path, the protectors, as well as those who are protected. On seeing Arjuna stationed in the battle in front of Saindhava, what did my extremely foolish son do? On seeing Satyaki fearlessly penetrate in the battle, what course of action, appropriate to the occasion, did Duryodhana adopt? Those supreme rathas, who are beyond the reach of all weapons, penetrated the army. On witnessing this in the encounter, what did those on my side decide to do? On beholding Dasharha Krishna stationed for Arjuna’s sake and on seeing the bull among the Shini lineage, I think that my sons must have been full of sorrow. On seeing that Satvata and Arjuna had passed through the soldiers and that the Kurus were running away, I <a id="calibre_link-2977" class="calibre2"></a>think that my sons must have been full of sorrow. On seeing that the rathas were routed and had lost interest in subjugating the enemy and on seeing that they had set their minds on running away, I think that my sons must have been full of sorrow. The seats of the chariots were rendered empty by Satvata and Arjuna. On seeing that the warriors were slain, I think that my sons must have been full of sorrow. On seeing horses, elephants and chariots and thousands of brave ones anxiously running away from the field of battle, I think that my sons must have been full of sorrow. Horses were deprived of brave ones. Men were deprived of their chariots by Satyaki and Partha. I think that my sons must have been full of sorrow. On seeing that all the masses of infantry had given up all hope of victory and were running away in every direction, I think that my sons must have been full of sorrow. On seeing that those two brave ones had instantly passed through Drona’s array, without being defeated, I think that my sons must have been full of sorrow. O son! I am extremely benumbed on hearing that Krishna and Dhananjaya, the ones without decay, have penetrated my soldiers, together with Satvata. Shini’s descendant, supreme among rathas, penetrated the army. After he had passed through Bhoja’s array, what did the Kouravas do? O Sanjaya! Tell me everything about how Drona afflicted the Pandus in the battle and how that battle progressed there. Drona is brave and powerful. He is skilled in the use of weapons and is firm in his valour. How did the Panchalas fight against that great archer in the battle? Desiring Dharmaraja’s victory, they are firm in their enmity towards Drona. Bharadvaja’s maharatha son is also firm in his enmity towards them. Wishing to kill the king of Sindhu, what did Arjuna do? O Sanjaya! You are skilled in this. Tell me everything about what transpired.”’</p>

Knowing your absence of qualities, your partiality towards your sons, your duplicity about dharma, your malice towards the Pandavas and your many piteous lamentations, Vasudeva, the one who knows about all the worlds and the lord and preceptor of all the worlds, caused the great war to arise among the Kurus. This great and pervasive destruction has arisen because of your own crimes. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! No good deeds by you can be seen at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end.

The Parthas, with Bhimasena at the forefront, advanced against your army. Maharatha Kritavarma alone resisted the Pandus in that battle, as they arrived in violence and anger, together with their followers. Just as the shoreline holds back the salty ocean, Hardikya repulsed the Pandu soldiers in that battle. Hardikya’s valour was regarded as extraordinary. The united Parthas could not crush him in that battle. The mighty-armed Bhima pierced Kritavarma with three iron arrows and blew on his conch shell, delighting all the Pandavas. Sahadeva pierced Hardikya with twenty arrows, Dharmaraja with five and Nakula with one hundred. Droupadi’s sons pierced him with seventy-three, Ghatotkacha with seven and Dhrishtadyumna struck Kritavarma with three.

Kritavarma pierced each of those maharathas with five arrows and piercing Bhima with seven, brought down his bow and his standard from his chariot. Once the bow was severed, the spirited maharatha angrily struck him in the chest with seventy arrows. Having been severely and powerfully struck by Hardikya’s supreme arrows, he trembled on his chariot, like a mountain during <a id="calibre_link-2982" class="calibre2"></a>an earthquake. On seeing Bhimasena in that state, they,<a id="calibre_link-573" href="#calibre_link-1166" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">229</sup></a> with Dharmaraja at the forefront, afflicted Kritavarma with the release of terrible arrows. O venerable one! They hemmed him in with a large number of chariots. To protect the son of the wind god in the battle, they cheerfully pierced him with arrows.”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2983">‘“The immensely strong Bhimasena recovered his senses. In that encounter, he grasped an iron javelin with a golden handle. From his chariot, he swiftly hurled it towards Kritavarma’s chariot. Released from Bhima’s arms, it was like a snake that has cast off its skin. Flaming extremely fiercely, it headed towards Kritavarma. On seeing it suddenly descend towards him, with a hue like that of the fire at the time of the destruction of a yuga, Hardikya used two arrows to slice it into two. That javelin, decorated with gold, was severed and fell down on the ground. O king! It illuminated the directions, like a giant meteor that has been dislodged from the sky. On seeing that the javelin had been destroyed, Bhima was extremely enraged. He picked up another bow that was forceful and made a great sound. In that battle, Bhimasena angrily attacked Hardikya and struck him between the breasts with five arrows. O king! Bhima was terrible in his strength and all this was because of your evil policy. O venerable one! Bhimasena mangled Bhoja in all his limbs. In that field of battle, he was as beautiful as a red <em class="calibre4">ashoka</em> tree that was blooming. However, that great archer only laughed. In that battle, he angrily struck Bhimasena with three arrows and then firmly and carefully, pierced those maharathas back with three arrows each. They also pierced him back with seven arrows each.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2984">‘“O descendant of the Bharata lineage! In that encounter, the maharatha laughed and wrathfully used a kshurapra arrow to sever Shikhandi’s bow. On seeing that his bow had been severed, Shikhandi became angry. In that encounter, he grasped a sword and a brilliant shield that was marked with one hundred moons. He whirled that giant shield, which was decorated with gold and dispatched the sword towards Kritavarma’s chariot. O king! In that encounter, the giant sword severed his bow and arrow and fell down on the <a id="calibre_link-2985" class="calibre2"></a>ground, like a stellar body dislodged from the firmament. At the same time, in the battle, those maharathas quickly and severely pierced Kritavarma with arrows. O foremost among the Bharata lineage! Hardikya, the destroyer of enemy heroes, discarded the giant bow, which had been shattered. In that encounter, he picked up another bow and pierced each of the Pandavas with three arrows. He pierced Shikhandi with three arrows, and then yet again with another five. The immensely illustrious Shikhandi picked up another bow and countered Hridika’s son with arrows that had heads made out of the nails of tortoises. O king! In that battle, Hridika’s son became angry and powerfully attacked Yajnasena’s maharatha son, the one who was responsible for the death of the great-souled Bhishma in the battle. O king! The brave and powerful one attacked him, like a tiger against an elephant. Those two were like flaming fires, or two elephants in charge of the directions. Those destroyers of enemies clashed against each other with a torrent of arrows and released showers of arrows at each other from the best of bows. They released hundreds of arrows, like the rays of two suns in the sky. Those two maharathas tormented each other with their sharp arrows. Those two brave ones were as resplendent as suns at the end of a yuga. Kritavarma fiercely struck Yajnasena’s maharatha son with seventy-three arrows and pierced him again with another seven. Severely pierced and wounded, he sat down on the floor of his chariot, letting go of his bow and arrows and becoming unconscious. O bull among the Bharata lineage! On seeing him thus distressed in the battle, those on your side honoured Hardikya and waved their garments around in the air. On discerning that Shikhandi was thus afflicted by Hardikya’s arrows, his charioteer swifly bore the maharatha away from the field of battle.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2986">‘“On seeing Shikhandi on the floor of the chariot in the battle, the Parthas quickly surrounded Kritavarma with chariots. Maharatha Kritavarma accomplished a supreme wonder there. In that battle, he single-handedly repulsed the Parthas and their followers. Having defeated the Parthas, maharatha Kritavarma vanquished the Chedis, the Panchalas, the Srinjayas and the Kekayas, all of whom were immensely valorous. In the battle, the Pandavas were slaughtered by <a id="calibre_link-2987" class="calibre2"></a>Hardikya. In that encounter, they were unable to retain their spirits and fled in all directions, bereft of their senses. In the battle, Hardikya defeated the sons of Pandu, with Bhimasena at the forefront. He was stationed there, like a fire without smoke. Those maharathas were driven away by Hardikya in the battle. They were afflicted by his shower of arrows and were forced to retreat.”’</p>

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-2989">‘Sanjaya said, “O king! Listen attentively to what you have asked. Those soldiers were driven away by the great-souled Hardikya. They were overcome by shame and those on your side were delighted. The Pandus were immersed in fathomless waters, without a refuge, and sought refuge. O king! In that great battle, on hearing the fierce roars emitted by those on your side, Shini’s descendant swiftly attacked Kritavarma.<a id="calibre_link-574" href="#calibre_link-1167" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">230</sup></a> Hardikya Kritavarma angrily covered Shini’s descendant with sharp arrows and Satyaki also became enraged. In the encounter, Shini’s descendant released an extremely sharp and broad-headed arrow at Kritavarma and shot another four arrows at him. These slew his horses and the broad-headed arrow severed his bow. Satyaki, for whom truth was his valour, used sharp arrows to pierce his charioteer and those who guarded his rear and thus deprived him of his chariot. He then afflicted the soldiers with arrows with drooping tufts. Oppressed by the arrows of Shini’s descendant, the army scattered. Satyaki, for whom truth was his valour, then swiftly departed. O king! Listen to what that valiant one did to your soldiers.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2990">‘“O great king! He passed through the giant ocean that was Drona’s army. Delighted at having vanquished Kritavarma in the battle, the brave one spoke these words to his charioteer. ‘Proceed slowly and fearlessly.’ On seeing your forces, with a large number of chariots, horses, elephants and infantry, he again spoke to the <a id="calibre_link-2991" class="calibre2"></a>charioteer. ‘The army on the left, which is like a cloud, is Drona’s. It has a large army of elephants and Rukmaratha is at the forefront.<a id="calibre_link-575" href="#calibre_link-1168" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">231</sup></a> O charioteer! There are many of them and they are unassailable in a battle. Instructed by Duryodhana, they are ready to give up their lives and are waiting for me. All these princes are great archers and are brave in fighting. These foremost of rathas come from Trigarta and their standards are embellished with gold. These brave ones are stationed there, desiring to fight with me. O charioteer! Urge the horses quickly and take me there. While Bharadvaja’s son looks on, I will fight with the Trigartas.’ The charioteer was obedient to Satvata’s instructions and slowly proceeded there, on a chariot that possessed the complexion of the sun and was radiant with flags. Supreme horses were harnessed to it and they were obedient to the charioteer. In a battle, they possessed the speed of the wind and their complexions were like the <em class="calibre4">kunda</em> flower,<a id="calibre_link-576" href="#calibre_link-1169" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">232</sup></a> the moon, or silver. The chariot bore him there, drawn by supreme horses that had the complexion of conch shells. In every direction, the brave ones surrounded him with an army of elephants. They showered many kinds of sharp arrows that could easily penetrate. Satvata also used sharp arrows to fight with that army of elephants. He was like a giant cloud that showers down on a mountain at the end of the summer. The arrows were like the vajra or thunder to the touch and slaughtered the elephants. They were driven away from the field of battle by Shini’s brave descendant. Their tusks were broken. They were covered in blood. Their temples and frontal lobes were shattered. Their ears, faces and trunks were lopped off. They were without riders and flags. Their armour and bells were fragmented. The giant standards were brought down. O king! The blankets were torn apart. With the riders slain, they roamed around in different directions. They shrieked and roared in many ways, like the thunder of the clouds. They were mangled by Satvata’s iron and vatsadanta arrows.</p>
<a id="calibre_link-2992" class="calibre2"></a>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2993">‘“When that army of elephants was routed, maharatha Jalasandha<a id="calibre_link-577" href="#calibre_link-1170" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">233</sup></a> urged the elephant that he was riding towards the chariot with the silvery horses. The brave one had a golden complexion and was adorned with armlets made of purified gold. He had earrings, a diadem and a conch shell and was smeared with red sandalwood paste. There was a flaming garland made out of gold around his head. There were golden and resplendent chains on his chest and around his neck. He was seated on the head of his elephant and stretched a golden bow. O great king! He was as radiant as a cloud tinged with lightning. On seeing Magadha suddenly descend on him on a supreme elephant, Satyaki countered him, like the shoreline driving back the ocean. The elephant was checked by the supreme arrows of Shini’s descendant. O king! On seeing this, the immensely strong Jalasandha became enraged in that battle. Angrily, the great archer Jalasandha pierced Shini’s grandson on his broad chest with arrows that were capable of bearing great loads. He then used another yellow, sharp and broad-headed arrow to sever the bow of the brave one from the Vrishni lineage, just as he was drawing it. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! Once the bow had been severed, the brave one from Magadha laughed and pierced Satyaki with five sharp arrows. He was pierced by many arrows released by the valiant Jalasandha. But the mighty-armed one did not waver and it was extraordinary. Without any fear, the powerful one thought about the arrows he should use. He took up another bow. Asking Jalasandha to wait, Shini’s descendant laughed and severely struck him on his broad chest with sixty arrows. He then used a yellow kshurapra arrow to sever Jalasandha’s giant bow in his hand and pierced him with three arrows. Jalasandha cast aside the bow, which had an arrow still affixed to it. O venerable one! He swiftly hurled a lance towards Satyaki. In that great battle, this pierced Madhava’s left arm and penetrated the earth, like a giant and fierce serpent that was sighing. When his left arm had been pierced, Satyaki, for whom truth was his valour, struck Jalasandha with thirty sharp arrows. <a id="calibre_link-2994" class="calibre2"></a>The immensely strong Jalasandha picked up a sword and a giant shield that was made out of the hide of bulls and was marked with the signs of one hundred moons. He whirled the sword and hurled it at Satvata. Severing the bow of Shini’s descendant, the sword fell down on the ground. When it fell down on the ground, it looked like a circle of fire. He<a id="calibre_link-578" href="#calibre_link-1171" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">234</sup></a> picked up another bow that was capable of shattering all bodies. It was as large as the trunk of a shala tree and its roar was like that of Indra’s vajra. He angrily stretched that bow and pierced Jalasandha with an arrow. The supreme one of the Madhava lineage laughed and used two kshurapra arrows to sever Jalasandha’s arms, with their ornaments and their armlets. Those arms were like clubs and fell down from that supreme of elephants. They fell down on the ground, like two five-headed serpents falling down from a mountain. With a third kshurapra arrow, Satyaki severed his head, possessing beautiful teeth and a handsome jaw and adorned with charming earrings. When the head and arms had been cut down, the torso looked fearful and sprinkled Jalasandha’s elephant with his blood. O lord of the earth! Having swiftly slain Jalasandha, Satvata brought down the housing from the elephant’s shoulder.<a id="calibre_link-579" href="#calibre_link-1172" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">235</sup></a> Jalasandha’s elephant was covered with blood, all over its limbs. He was hanging upside down from that supreme seat. Afflicted by Satvata’s arrows, the giant elephant fled, uttering terrible and piteous shrieks, and crushing its own soldiers.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-2995">‘“O venerable one! On seeing that Jalasandha had been slain by the bull among the Vrishni lineage, a giant roar of lamentation arose among your soldiers. Your warriors retreated and fled in different directions. They were interested in running away and not in defeating the enemy. O king! At this time, Drona, supreme among those who wielded weapons, quickly approached maharatha Yuyudhana, borne on his swift horses. On seeing that Shini’s descendant was rampaging, many bulls among the Kurus angrily surrounded Satyaki, together <a id="calibre_link-2996" class="calibre2"></a>with Drona. A battle commenced between the Kurus, with Drona, and Satvata. O king! It was a terrible clash, like that between the gods and the asuras.”’</p>

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-2998">‘Sanjaya said, “O great king! All of them swiftly fought with Yuyudhana. They were skilled in striking and made endeavours. They showered down a storm of arrows. He struck Drona with seventy-seven sharp arrows. Durmarshana struck him with twelve arrows, Duhsaha with ten. Vikarna struck him on his left side and between the breasts with thirty sharp arrows that were tufted with the feathers of herons. Durmukha struck him with ten arrows and Duhshasana with eight. O venerable one! Chitrasena pierced Shini’s descendant with two arrows. Duryodhana brought down a great shower of arrows on Madhava. O king! In that battle, other maharathas also afflicted him. Your maharatha sons countered him from all directions. However, Shini’s descendant pierced each of them back with separate arrows. He struck Bharadvaja’s son with three arrows, Duhsaha with nine, Vikarna with twenty-five, Chitrasena with seven, Durmarshana with twelve, Vivimshati with four, Satyavrata with nine and Vijaya with ten arrows. The maharatha struck Rukmangada’s bow and brandished his own bow. Satyaki then quickly advanced against your maharatha son.<a id="calibre_link-580" href="#calibre_link-1173" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">236</sup></a> While everyone looked on, he severely pierced the king, supreme among the wielders of all weapons, with his arrows and a battle commenced between the two. Both of them affixed and released sharp arrows. In that battle, those two maharathas rendered each other invisible. Pierced by Satyaki, the king of the Kurus looked extremely beautiful. A lot of blood flowed from his body, like the sap from a sandalwood tree. Satvata was also pierced by a mass of arrows released by your son. He <a id="calibre_link-2999" class="calibre2"></a>was as beautiful as a golden sacrificial stake that had been erected. O king! In that battle, the Madhava archer suddenly severed the Kuru king’s bow with a kshurapra arrow and laughed. When the bow had been severed, he released many arrows and pierced the enemy with those swift-acting arrows. In the battle, the king could not tolerate these signs of victory on the part of his foe. He grasped another unassailable bow that possessed a golden back and quickly pierced Satyaki with a hundred arrows. He was severely and powerfully struck by your archer son. Overcome by sentiments of intolerance, he began to afflict your son. On seeing that the king was oppressed, your maharatha sons showered powerful arrows on Satvata and enveloped him. When he was shrouded by your maharatha sons in many ways, he pierced each of them with five arrows and pierced them again with seven each. He swiftly struck Duryodhana with eight arrows. Laughing, he severed his bow and frightened the enemy. With more arrows, he brought down his standard, which was decorated with a bejewelled elephant. He used four sharp arrows to slay his four horses. The immensely illustrious one then brought down the charioteer with a kshurapra arrow. The maharatha countered the king of the Kurus with many arrows that were capable of penetrating the inner organs and was delighted. O king! Having been thus struck in the battle by the supreme arrows released by Shini’s descendant, your son, Duryodhana, suddenly fled. The archer king mounted Chitrasena’s chariot and a great lamentation arose in the world on seeing that the king was about to be devoured by Satyaki, like the moon by Rahu.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3000">‘“On hearing this great uproar, maharatha Kritavarma suddenly advanced towards the spot where the illustrious Madhava was. He brandished his supreme bow and censured his charioteer, urging him to speedily goad the horses and head swiftly in that direction. O great king! On seeing that he was descending, like Death with a gaping mouth, Yuyudhana spoke to his charioteer. ‘With his arrows, Kritavarma is quickly advancing towards me on his chariot. Drive your chariot and let us clash against this supreme of all archers.’ The horses were prepared well and were fast and advanced in the battle against Bhoja, who was revered by archers. Those two tigers <a id="calibre_link-3001" class="calibre2"></a>among men were extremely angry and were like blazing fires. They clashed against each other, like two spirited tigers. Kritavarma struck Shini’s descendant with twenty-six sharp arrows and his charioteer with seven. He struck Satvata’s four horses, which were from the Sindhu region and were well trained and well controlled, with four supreme arrows. His<a id="calibre_link-581" href="#calibre_link-1174" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">237</sup></a> standard was golden and he brandished his giant bow, with a golden back. His armlets were golden and his armour was golden. He countered him with gold-tufted arrows. Wishing to leave and see Dhananjaya, Shini’s descendant also quickly struck Kritavarma with sharp arrows. Struck by his powerful enemy, the unassailable scorcher of enemies<a id="calibre_link-582" href="#calibre_link-1175" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">238</sup></a> trembled, like a mountain during an earthquake. Satyaki then quickly pierced Kritavarma’s four horses with sixty-three sharp arrows and his charioteer with seven. Satyaki then affixed an arrow with golden tufts and released it. It blazed like a giant fire and was like an angry serpent. The arrow was like Yama’s staff and he released it at Kritavarma. It penetrated his armour, which shone like the sun and was decorated with colourful gold. Having drunk his blood, it fiercely penetrated the earth. Afflicted by Satvata, he was drenched in blood. He cast aside his bow and sank down on the floor of the supreme chariot. His teeth were like that of a lion and he was infinite in his valour. But afflicted by Satyaki’s arrows, the bull among men sank down on his knees on the floor of the chariot. Having countered Kritavarma, who was like the thousand-armed one<a id="calibre_link-583" href="#calibre_link-1176" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">239</sup></a> and like an ocean that cannot be agitated, Satyaki left. That place was full of swords, lances and bows and populated by elephants, horses and chariots. It looked terrible, because of the blood shed by the bulls among the kshatriyas. While all the soldiers looked on, the bull of the Shini lineage passed through it. He immersed himself in that army and penetrated it, like the slayer of Vritra through an army of asuras. Meanwhile, Hardikya grasped another giant bow and stationed there, began to powerfully resist and fight with the Pandavas.”’</p>

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3004">‘Sanjaya said, “At the time when the soldiers were scattered by Shini’s descendant, Bharadvaja’s son repulsed him with a great shower of arrows. While all the soldiers looked on, a tumultuous clash commenced between Drona and Satvata, like that between Bali and Vasava. Drona pierced Shini’s grandson in the forehead with three colourful arrows that were completely made out of iron and were like venomous snakes. O great king! Pierced in the forehead by those arrows, Yuyudhana was as beautiful as a mountain with three peaks. Bharadvaja’s son was looking for an opportunity in the battle. He released many other arrows, with roars like those of Indra’s vajra. While the arrows released from Drona’s bow were descending, Dasharha, who was supreme in the knowledge of weapons, severed them with two arrows that had excellent tufts. O lord of the earth! On beholding this dexterity of hand, Drona smiled and suddenly struck the bull among the Shini lineage with twenty arrows. He surpassed Yuyudhana’s lightness of hand with his own dexterity and pierced him with fifty arrows, and then yet again with one hundred. O king! They arose from Drona’s chariot, like large and angry serpents from a termite hill, and penetrated his body. In that fashion, Yuyudhana released hundreds and thousands of arrows. Those arrows could drink up blood and enveloped Drona’s chariot. O venerable one! No difference in dexterity could be seen between the foremost of brahmanas and Satyaki. Those bulls among men were equal. Extremely angry, Satyaki struck Drona with nine arrows with drooping tufts and also struck his standard with sharp arrows. While Bharadvaja’s son looked on, he struck his charioteer with one hundred arrows. On witnessing Yuyudhana’s dexterity, maharatha Drona pierced Satyaki with seventy arrows and each of the horses with three. With a single arrow, he pierced the standard that was stationed on Madhava’s chariot. In that battle, he then used another broad-headed arrow with golden tufts to sever the great-souled Madhava’s bow. At this, maharatha Satyaki became very angry. He discarded that bow. He grasped a giant club and <a id="calibre_link-3005" class="calibre2"></a>hurled it at Bharadvaja’s son. It was made completely out of iron and was bound with strips of cloth. It descended suddenly. However, Drona used many arrows of diverse kinds to counter it. Satyaki, for whom truth was his valour, then grasped another bow. He pierced Bharadvaja’s brave son with many arrows that had been sharpened on stone. He pierced Drona in the battle and roared like a lion. But Drona, supreme among the wielders of all weapons, could not tolerate this. He grasped an iron javelin with a golden handle and swiftly hurled it towards Madhava’s chariot. That javelin was like death, but it did not reach Shini’s descendant. It shattered his chariot and with a terrible noise, fiercely penetrated the ground. O king! O bull among the Bharata lineage! Shini’s grandson pierced Drona with arrows and struck him on his right arm. O king! In that battle, using an arrow that was in the shape of a half-moon, Drona severed Madhava’s great bow and struck the charioteer of his chariot with a javelin. For an instant, he<a id="calibre_link-584" href="#calibre_link-1177" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">240</sup></a> sank down senseless on the floor of the chariot. O king! Satyaki then performed a superhuman deed there. He grasped the reins himself and fought with Drona. O lord of the earth! In that encounter, maharatha Yuyudhana pierced the brahmana with a hundred arrows and was delighted. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! Drona released five arrows at him. In the battle, they penetrated his armour and drank his blood. Pierced by those terrible arrows, Satyaki became extremely angry. The brave one released arrows towards the one with the golden chariot. With an arrow, he brought Drona’s charioteer down on the ground. With the great-souled Drona’s charioteer slain, the horses began to run away. O king! In that battle, the radiant chariot whirled around in a thousand circles, like the sun. ‘Drona’s horses are running away. Grab them.’ These were the sounds that arose from all the princes and the kings. O king! The maharathas quickly abandoned the battle with Satyaki. All of them swiftly rushed to the spot where Drona was. On seeing that all of them were running away, afflicted by Satvata’s arrows, your soldiers were again shattered and distressed. Drona went and again stationed himself at the mouth of the vyuha. <a id="calibre_link-3006" class="calibre2"></a>He had been borne away by horses that were as fleet as the wind and had been afflicted by Vrishni’s arrows. The valiant one<a id="calibre_link-585" href="#calibre_link-1178" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">241</sup></a> saw that the vyuha had been shattered by the Pandus and the Panchalas. Therefore, he devoted himself to protecting the vyuha and did not follow Shini’s descendant. The fire that was Drona consumed and countered the Pandus and the Panchalas. The flame of his ire blazed, like the sun that arises at the end of a yuga.”’</p>

Having vanquished Drona and other foremost men on your side, with Hardikya at the forefront, the brave one of the Shini lineage laughed and spoke these words to his charioteer. ‘O charioteer! We are only instruments today. They have been consumed by Keshava and Phalguna. We have slain those whom that bull among men, the son of the lord of the gods, has already killed.’ Having thus spoken in that great battle, the bull among the Shini lineage, fierce archer and the destroyer of enemies, swiftly showered powerful arrows in every direction, like a hawk in search of flesh. The foremost of brave ones was borne on horses that had the complexion of the moon, or conch shells. He immersed himself in the soldiers and though they surrounded him from all sides, no one was capable of withstanding him. That fierce man was like the rays of the sun. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! He was valiant and his spirit was indomitable. Not a single one from those masses was capable of standing up to him. His prowess was like that of the one with a thousand eyes.<a id="calibre_link-586" href="#calibre_link-1179" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">242</sup></a> He was like the sun in the firmament, when the rainy season is over.</p>

That supreme among kings advanced against Satyaki <a id="calibre_link-3010" class="calibre2"></a>and sought to counter him. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! An extremely terrible encounter took place between them and the warriors on your side, and the Somakas praised it. The large number of immortals compared it to that between Vritra and Indra. Sudarshana pierced the foremost one of the Satvata lineage with hundreds of extremely sharp arrows. But before those arrows could reach him, the bull among the Shini lineage struck them down with his own arrows. Sudarshana was stationed on his chariot. In similar fashion, when Satyaki, who was like Shakra, released arrows at him, Sudarshana severed those supreme arrows into two or three fragments. On seeing that his arrows were destroyed by the force of Satyaki’s arrows, Sudarshana, whose energy was fierce, became angry. He released golden and colourful arrows. He drew his bow completely back up to his ear and again released three sharp arrows that had excellent tufts and were like the fire. These pierced Satyaki’s body armour and penetrated his body. Yet again, the son of the king affixed another four flaming arrows and struck the four horses that possessed the complexion of silver. Shini’s grandson was like Indra in his valour. Thus afflicted, the spirited one quickly released a mass of extremely sharp arrows and killed Sudarshana’s horses, roaring loudly. He released a broad-headed arrow that was like the vajra or thunder and sliced off the head of his<a id="calibre_link-587" href="#calibre_link-1180" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">243</sup></a> charioteer. The brave one from the Shini lineage then used a kshurapra arrow to sever Sudarshana’s head. It sported earrings and was like the full moon. It possessed a radiant face and was severed from the body. O king! This was like the battle in ancient times, when the wielder of the vajra used extreme force to kill Bala. Having slain the son and the grandson of a king in the battle, the spirited and great-souled bull of the Yadu lineage was overcome by great delight. He was as resplendent as the king of the gods. He then followed the path that Arjuna had taken, repulsing your soldiers with his mass of arrows. The chariot was borne by well-trained horses and the brave one among men filled everyone with wonder. All the supreme warriors who were assembled there honoured him and wondered at his fierce <a id="calibre_link-3011" class="calibre2"></a>deeds. With his arrows, he was like a blazing fire that consumed everything that came within the range of the arrows.”’</p>

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3014">‘Sanjaya said, “The great-souled and intelligent Satyaki, the bull of the Vrishni lineage, killed Sudarshana and spoke these words to his charioteer. ‘O son!<a id="calibre_link-588" href="#calibre_link-151" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">244</sup></a> We have passed through the impenetrable and great ocean that is Drona’s army. It is full of chariots, horses and elephants. The arrows and javelins are the garlands of waves. The swords are the fish and the clubs are the crocodiles. The weapons of the brave ones make a loud roar. This is terrible and is destructive of life. There is a terrible din created by musical instruments. Warriors find this pleasant to the touch. But it is unassailable to those who desire victory. There are the forces of Jalasandha, surrounded by flesh-eating ones. But I think that the remaining part of the army is like a small river. It only has a little bit of water. Therefore, fearlessly, urge the horses forward. I think that Savyasachi is only the distance of a hand away and we will reach him. In the battle, we have vanquished the intolerable Drona and his followers and Hardikya, supreme among warriors. I think that we have reached Dhananjaya. At the sight of innumerable soldiers, no fear is engendered in me. They are like dried grass during the summer, before a blazing fire. Behold. This is the ground along which Kiriti, the foremost of the Pandavas, has passed. It has been rendered uneven by large numbers of infantry, horses, chariots and elephants that have fallen. I think that we are close to the one with the white horses, with Krishna as the charioteer. The sound of the infinitely energetic Gandiva can be heard. From the omens that manifest themselves before me, Arjuna will kill Saindhava before the sun has set. Go slowly and preserve the strength of the horses. Proceed towards the army of the enemy. That <a id="calibre_link-3015" class="calibre2"></a>is where the armoured ones are, with Suyodhana at the forefront. The Kambojas are indomitable in battle. They are armoured and are the performers of cruel deeds. There are armed Yavanas, wielding bows and arrows. There are Shakas, Kiratas, Daradas, Barbaras and Tamraliptakas. There are many other mlecchas, with diverse weapons in their hands. All of them are stationed with their faces towards me, wishing to fight. This is an extremely terrible fortress, with chariots, elephants and infantry. But consider that we have already passed through this and have slain them.’</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3016">‘“The charioteer replied, ‘O Varshneya! O one who has truth as his valour! Know that I have no fear, even if the extremely enraged son of Jamadagni<a id="calibre_link-589" href="#calibre_link-152" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">245</sup></a> were to be stationed before us now. O mighty-armed one! Even if it were to be Drona, best among rathas, or Kripa, or the lord of Madra, I have no fear as long as I am under your protection. O destroyer of enemies! You have already vanquished many of them in battle. I have never exhibited any fear in battle. O brave one! Why should I show it now, in this battle with a trifle?<a id="calibre_link-590" href="#calibre_link-153" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">246</sup></a> O one with a long life! Which route shall I take to reach Dhananjaya? O Varshneya! Whom are you angry with? To whom has death presented itself? Who have made up their minds to go to Yama’s residence today? You are like death at the end of a yuga and exhibit your valour in battle. On witnessing this valour, which warriors will run away? O mighty-armed one! Who are the ones whom King Vaivasvata<a id="calibre_link-591" href="#calibre_link-154" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">247</sup></a> has remembered today?’</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3017">‘“Satyaki said, ‘Like Vasava against the danavas, I will slay the ones with the shaved heads and fulfil my vow. Take me towards the Kambojas. Having caused carnage among them today, I will swiftly go to Pandava. The Kouravas, together with Suyodhana, will witness my valour today. O charioteer! I will afflict all the soldiers and kill the ones with the shaven heads. In the battle today, I will shatter the <a id="calibre_link-3018" class="calibre2"></a>soldiers of the Kouravas. Having heard many kinds of lamentations, Suyodhana will be satisfied. Today, in the battle, I will show my preceptor, the great-souled one with the white horses, who is foremost among the Pandavas, the path that he has indicated to me. Thousands of foremost among warriors will be slain by my arrows today. On witnessing this, King Duryodhana will suffer from repentance. I will release supreme arrows today, using the dexterity of my hands. The Kouravas will behold my bow, like a circle of fire. My arrows will make copious quantities of blood flow from their limbs. On witnessing the slaughter of the soldiers, Suyodhana will suffer from repentance. In my angry form, I will slay the best of the best today. Today, Suyodhana will think that the world has two Arjunas. In the battle today, thousands of kings will be killed by me. On witnessing this, King Duryodhana will repent the great battle. Today, I will show my affection and devotion to the great-souled Pandavas. I will kill thousands of kings and show the king.’”<a id="calibre_link-592" href="#calibre_link-155" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">248</sup></a></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3019">‘Sanjaya said, “Thus instructed, the charioteer urged Yuyudhana’s supreme horses, which were trained and well skilled. Those horses had the complexion of the moon and he urged them to their greatest speed. They possessed the speed of the wind, or of thought, and seemed to devour the sky as they quickly sped to the spot where the Yavanas were. As he reached that army, without retreating, they exhibited the dexterity of their hands and enveloped Satyaki with many showers of arrows. O king! But before those arrows could reach him, Satyaki used his powerful arrows with drooping tufts to sever those arrows and other weapons. He then used extremely sharp arrows that were gold-tufted, with the feathers of vultures, to sever the heads and arms of the Yavanas. Some of those arrows penetrated the armour made out of steel and brass and passing through the bodies, penetrated the earth in every direction. In the battle, the mlecchas were slaughtered by the brave Satyaki. Hundreds of them lost their lives and fell down on the ground. The bow was drawn back to its full extent and an incessant stream of arrows was shot. He afflicted and oppressed them and killed five, six, seven and <a id="calibre_link-3020" class="calibre2"></a>eight Yavana’s with a single arrow. O lord of the earth! Thousands of Kambojas, Shakas, Shabaras, Kiratas and Barbaras fell down and the earth was full of mire made out of flesh and blood. Shini’s descendant caused a great destruction among your forces. The earth was strewn everywhere with the helmets of bandits<a id="calibre_link-593" href="#calibre_link-156" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">249</sup></a> and their severed and shaved heads, which looked like birds without feathers. The field of battle was resplendent, with blood and wounds on the limbs of torsos that were strewn in every direction, like the sky covered with coppery clouds. The arrows had excellent joints and were like the vajra or thunder to the touch. Horses and carts were destroyed and scattered around on the ground. The few that were left were scattered. They sought to protect their lives and were bereft of their senses. O great king! In that battle, those armoured ones were vanquished by Yuyudhana. They used their whips to urge the parshnis and horses to adopt the greatest speed and run away in different directions. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! In that battle, he drove away the invincible Kamboja soldiers, the soldiers of the Yavanas and the great army of Shakas. Thus did Satyaki, the tiger among men for whom truth was his valour, defeat those on your side. He was delighted and urged his charioteer to proceed. O lord of the earth! On seeing that he was advancing as the one who was protecting Arjuna’s rear, the charanas were delighted, and together with those on your side, honoured him.”’</p>
<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-3021">Chapter 1073(96)</h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3022">‘Sanjaya said, “Having defeated the Yavanas and the Kambojas, Yuyudhana, supreme among rathas, passed through the midst of your soldiers and headed towards Arjuna. That tiger among men possessed arrows as his teeth. His colourful armour was like a picture. He was like a tiger slaying deer and terrified the soldiers. <a id="calibre_link-3023" class="calibre2"></a>As he traversed along the path on his chariot, he fiercely brandished his bow. It was extremely powerful and had a golden back. It was decorated with golden moons. His armlets and helmet were golden and he was covered in golden armour. The brave one possessed a supreme golden standard that was as resplendent as Meru’s summit. In the battle, the circle of his bow had energy like that of the sun with its rays. He was like the sun when it has arisen in the autumn and, among those men, was as resplendent as the sun. The bull among men had the shoulders of a bull. He was brave and had the eyes of a bull. He penetrated the midst of your soldiers, like a bull in the midst of cattle. He was like a maddened elephant, advancing against another maddened elephant. He was like an elephant with shattered temples, stationed in the midst of a herd. Those on your side advanced against him in the battle, as if they wished to be killed by a tiger. He passed through Drona’s army and through the impenetrable army of Bhoja. He passed through the ocean that was Jalasandha and through the army of the Kambojas. He crossed through that ocean of soldiers and escaped from the makara that was Hardikya.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3024">‘“Satyaki was then surrounded by extremely enraged rathas from your side. There were Duryodhana, Chitrasena, Duhshasana, Vivimshati, Shakuni, Duhsaha, the youthful Durmarshana, Kratha and many other brave and invincible ones who were armed. As Satyaki proceeded, they angrily followed him from behind. O venerable one! A great uproar then arose amidst your soldiers. It was like the ocean agitated by the force of the wind during the night of the full moon or the new moon. The bull among the Shini lineage glanced at all those who were advancing against him. He laughed and addressed his charioteer, ‘Advance slowly. This army of Dhritarashtra’s son is advancing against me. It is swiftly headed in my direction, with elephants, horses and infantry. O charioteer! All the directions are resounding with the roar of chariots. The earth, the firmament and the ocean are trembling. O son! In this great battle, I will counter this ocean of soldiers, like the shoreline resisting the abode of the waters, when it swells at the time of the full moon. O charioteer! Behold my valour in this great battle, like that of Indra. I will pierce the soldiers of the enemy with sharp arrows. Behold. In the battle, I <a id="calibre_link-3025" class="calibre2"></a>will slay the infantry, horses, rathas and elephants and pierce their bodies with thousands of my arrows that are like the fire.’ While the infinitely energetic Satyaki was speaking in this way, the soldiers quickly approached him, wishing to fight. ‘Kill. Attack. Stay. Watch. See.’ These were the words those brave ones spoke. Satyaki killed three hundred horses and four hundred elephants with his sharp arrows. The encounter that ensued between him and those archers was tumultuous and led to the destruction of men, like the famous battle between the gods and the asuras. O venerable one! Your son’s soldiers were like a mass of clouds. However, Shini’s grandson received them with arrows that were like venomous serpents. O great king! Without any fear, in that battle, the valiant one shrouded them with a net of arrows and killed many on your side. O Indra among kings! The spectacle that I witnessed there was supremely wonderful. Not a single one of Satyaki’s arrows was unsuccessful. That large ocean of soldiers was full of chariots, elephants and horses and also full of foot soldiers and was forced to stand still when it encountered Shini’s descendant as the shoreline. The terrified men, elephants and steeds in your army advanced and were slain in every direction by the arrows. They roamed around there, like cattle afflicted by the winter. We did not see any infantry, chariots, elephants, riders and horses that were not pierced by Yuyudhana’s arrows. O king! Not even Phalguna had caused such carnage amongst the army, as was caused by Satyaki. O king! O bull among the Bharata lineage! Shini’s grandson surpassed Arjuna in the battle.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3026">‘“King Duryodhana pierced Satvata with three arrows, pierced his charioteer and struck his four horses with four arrows. He then pierced Satyaki with three arrows and again struck him with another eight. Duhshasana pierced the bull among the Shini lineage with sixteen arrows, Shakuni with twenty-five, Chitrasena with five and Duhsaha pierced Satyaki in the chest with fifteen arrows. O great king! The tiger among the Vrishni lineage was thus struck by their arrows and pierced each of them back with three arrows. The supremely energetic one severely pierced them. Shini’s descendant was dexterous and brave and roamed around in that battle, like a hawk. He severed Soubala’s bow and his arm-guard. He pierced <a id="calibre_link-3027" class="calibre2"></a>Duryodhana between the breasts with three arrows. The bull among the Shini lineage pierced Chitrasena with a hundred arrows, Duhsaha with ten and Duhshasana with twenty. O lord of the earth! Your brother-in-law<a id="calibre_link-594" href="#calibre_link-157" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">250</sup></a> picked up another bow and pierced Satyaki with eight arrows, following this up with another five. O king! Duhshasana pireced Satyaki with ten arrows, Duhsaha with three and Durmukha with twelve. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! Duryodhana pierced Madhava with seventy-three arrows and then used three sharp arrows to pierce his charioteer. All those brave maharathas made their efforts and Satyaki pierced them back with five arrows each. O lord! He used a broad-headed arrow to kill your son’s charioteer<a id="calibre_link-595" href="#calibre_link-158" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">251</sup></a> and bring him down on the ground from the chariot. O king! O lord of the earth! When the charioteer was killed, the horses that had the speed of the wind and the soldiers bore the chariot away from the field of battle. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! On seeing that the king’s chariot was running away, hundreds of your soldiers fled. Satyaki enveloped them with sharp arrows that were gold-tufted and had been sharpened on stone. In every direction, he drove away all your soldiers. O king! Satyaki then advanced towards the chariot of the one with the white horses. He released arrows and protected himself and his charioteer and those on your side honoured him.”’</p>

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3029">‘Dhritarashtra said, “Shini’s descendant proceeded towards Arjuna, crushing that large army. O Sanjaya! What did my shameless sons do? When they confronted death in that battle, how did they hold up their spirits? The conduct of Shini’s descendant is like that of Savyasachi. In the midst of the soldiers, how could the <a id="calibre_link-3030" class="calibre2"></a>kshatriyas bear to be defeated? How did the immensely illustrious Satyaki pass through them in that battle? O Sanjaya! As long as my sons were alive there, how could Shini’s descendant progress in that battle? Tell me everything in detail. O son!<a id="calibre_link-596" href="#calibre_link-159" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">252</sup></a> What I have heard from you, about the clash between one and many, with maharathas on the side of the enemy, is extremely wonderful. I think that destiny must be against my sons and they suffer from ill fortune, since they are being slain in the battle by the great-souled Satvata. O Sanjaya! A single one is sufficient to counter my entire army. When Yuyudhana is angry, let all the Pandavas remain standing.<a id="calibre_link-597" href="#calibre_link-160" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">253</sup></a> He has vanquished Drona, who is accomplished and unassailable in fighting, in the battle. Satyaki will kill my sons, like a lion against large numbers of deer. There were many brave warriors, Kritavarma and the others. But in the battle, they were incapable of fighting with that bull among men and he will kill them. Phalguna himself was incapable of fighting in the way that Shini’s immensely illustrious grandson fought.”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3031">‘Sanjaya replied, “O king! All this has happened because of Duryodhana’s evil counsel and deeds. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! Listen attentively to what I am telling you. On your son’s instructions, the samshaptakas returned, having made up their minds to fight to their utmost. There were three thousand riders, with Duryodhana at the forefront&mdash;Shakas, Kambojas, Bahlikas, Yavanas, Paradas, Kunindas, Tanganas, Ambashthas, Pishachas and those from mountainous regions. They attacked Shini’s descendant, like insects towards a flame. They were joined by rathas from the mountainous regions, those who fought with stones. O king! Five hundred such brave ones attacked Shini’s descendant. There were one thousand rathas and a hundred maharathas. There were one thousand elephants and two thousand horses. Those maharathas showered many different kinds of arrows. In that battle, infantry attacked Shini’s descendant. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! O great king! Duhshasana urged all of them to surround Satyaki and kill him. We witnessed the great and marvellous conduct of Shini’s <a id="calibre_link-3032" class="calibre2"></a>descendant. Without any fear, he single-handedly fought against many. He slew that array of rathas, the army of elephants, all the riders and all those dasyus. He mangled and routed them with his supreme weapons. Many wheels were shattered and beautiful chariot poles were destroyed. Bumpers were fragmented and standards brought down. The earth was strewn with armour and whisks. O venerable one! There were garlands, ornaments, garments and yokes. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! The earth was littered with these, like the sky with planets. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! The best of elephants, with the forms of mountains, were brought down. They were born in the lineages of Anjana, Vamana, Supratika, Mahapadma, Airavata and many other lineages.<a id="calibre_link-598" href="#calibre_link-161" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">254</sup></a> O king! The best of tuskers were slain in large numbers and lay down there. O king! The best of horses, from Vanayu, mountainous regions, Kamboja and Bahlika breeds, were slain there by Satyaki. There were foot soldiers who had been raised in many different countries, born in many races. Hundreds and thousands of them were killed there by Shini’s descendant.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3033">‘“When the soldiers confronted death in this way, Duhshasana spoke to the dasyus. ‘Return. You are not those who are familiar with dharma.<a id="calibre_link-599" href="#calibre_link-162" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">255</sup></a> Why are you running away without fighting?’ On seeing that they did not listen, your son, Duhshasana, urged the brave ones from the mountainous regions, the ones who fought with stones. ‘You are skilled in fighting with stones and Satyaki is not familiar with this. You know about fighting with stones. Use that mode to kill the one who desires to fight. None of the Kurus are skilled in fighting with stones. Do not be frightened. Attack. Satyaki will not be able to approach you. Those mountain-dwellers raised boulders that were like elephant cubs, and desiring death, advanced against Yuyudhana. <a id="calibre_link-3034" class="calibre2"></a>Others hurled those at him, wishing to kill Satvata. They were urged by your son and hemmed him in from all directions. On seeing them descend on him, desiring to fight with boulders, Satyaki fought against them and released three hundred arrows. Those from the mountainous regions rained down a tumultuous shower of boulders. However, the bull among the Shini lineage countered these with iron arrows that were like serpents. These shattered the boulders and the fragments shone like fireflies. O venerable one! Some of these slew the soldiers and sounds of lamentation arose. O king! There were five hundred brave ones with giant boulders raised. Their arms were severed and fell down on the ground. Other brave ones who fought with stones were stationed there. Many thousands of these were slain and it was extraordinary. The foremost among them again attacked, showering boulders from every direction. They held iron in their hands. There were Daradas with spears in their hands and Khasas and Tanganas. There were Ambashthas and Kunindas. They were enraged and Satyaki was also wrathful. The immensely strong one released iron arrows and countered them. With his sharp arrows, he shattered those boulders in the sky. O king! This produced a noise that made elephants, horses, rathas and infantry run away. Struck by shards from those boulders, powerful and armoured men were incapable of remaining there and roamed around. The remaining elephants<a id="calibre_link-600" href="#calibre_link-163" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">256</sup></a> were covered with blood. Their heads and frontal globes were shattered. They ran away from Yuyudhana’s chariot. O venerable one! A great noise arose among your soldiers when they were afflicted by Madhava, like that of the fierce ocean.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3035">‘“On hearing this tumultuous sound, Drona told his charioteer. ‘O charioteer! In this battle, maharatha Satvata is angry. As he roams around in the encounter, like Death, he is shattering the soldiers in many ways. O charioteer! Take the chariot to the spot where the tumultuous sound has arisen. There is no doubt that Yuyudhana is fighting with the mountain-dwellers. It is there that all the rathas are being destroyed and the horses are running away. The foot soldiers are bereft of their armour. They are wounded and are falling down. <a id="calibre_link-3036" class="calibre2"></a>In that melee, the charioteers can no longer control their horses.’ Having been thus addressed by Bharadvaja’s intelligent son, the charioteer spoke to Drona, supreme among those who wielded weapons. ‘O one with a long life! The Kourava soldiers are running away, in every direction. Behold. The warriors have been shattered and are fleeing here and there. The brave Panchalas and Pandavas have united. They are attacking us from every direction, wishing to kill you. O destroyer of enemies! The time has come for you to decide what must be done. Should we remain here, or should we advance further, towards where Satyaki is proceeding?’ O venerable one! Thus did he speak to Bharadvaja’s son. At that time, Shini’s descendant was seen, killing many different kinds of rathas. In the encounter, those on your side were killed by Yuyudhana. They abandoned Yuyudhana’s chariot and fled towards Drona’s army. All of them were terrified and fled towards Drona’s chariot. With other rathas, Duhshasana had already retreated there earlier.”’</p>

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3038">‘Sanjaya said, “On seeing that Duhshasana’s chariot was stationed near his, Bharadvaja’s son spoke these words to Duhshasana. ‘O Duhshasana! Why are all these rathas running away? Is the king well and is Saindhava still alive? You are a prince and your brother is a maharatha. Why are you running away from the battle? Accept the status of heir apparent.<a id="calibre_link-601" href="#calibre_link-164" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">257</sup></a> You have yourself brought on this great enmity with the Panchalas and Pandavas. In the battle, how can you be frightened of the single-handed Satyaki? In the gambling match in earlier times, when you grasped the dice, did you not know that they would become terrible arrows in the future, like venomous <a id="calibre_link-3039" class="calibre2"></a>serpents? Your words towards the Pandavas were especially hateful. You were the cause of the hardships that Droupadi faced in earlier times. Where is that insolence, pride and swagger about valour now? You enraged the Parthas, who are like venomous serpents. Why are you running away now? The army of the Bharatas is sorrowing now, as is King Suyodhana. He has a harsh brother, who is now intent on running away. O brave one! The army is shattered and is afflicted by terror. There is no doubt that you should resort to the strength of your arms and protect it now. But you are abandoning the fight in fright now and are delighting the enemy. O destroyer of enemies! You are the leader of your army and are fleeing. When the refuge is itself frightened, which other terrified person will remain stationed in the battle? O unblemished one! You are fighting with the single-handed Satvata now. Even then, your mind turns towards flying from the field of battle. O Kourava! What will you do when you behold the wielder of Gandiva, Bhimasena and the twins in the battle? In a battle, Phalguna’s arrows are like the sun and the fire in their energy. Satyaki’s arrows are equal to those and you are terrified and are running away from those. In that event, let there be peace and hand over the earth to Dharmaraja. Have peace with the Pandavas before Phalguna’s iron arrows, which are like snakes that have cast off their skins, penetrate your body. Have peace with the Pandavas before the great-souled Parthas kill one hundred of your brothers in battle and fling them down on the ground.<a id="calibre_link-602" href="#calibre_link-165" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">258</sup></a> Have peace with the Pandavas before King Yudhishthira, Dharma’s son, and Krishna, who prides himself in battle, are enraged. Have peace with the Pandavas before the mighty-armed Bhima penetrates the large army and grasps your brothers. This is what Bhishma told your brother Suyodhana earlier. “O amiable one! The Pandavas cannot be vanquished in battle. Have peace with the Pandavas.” But your wicked brother, Suyodhana, did not act accordingly. Therefore, resolve to fight and endeavour to battle with the Pandavas. Swiftly go on your chariot to the spot where Satyaki is stationed. O descendant of the Bharata <a id="calibre_link-3040" class="calibre2"></a>lineage! Without your presence, the army will be driven away. Truth is Satyaki’s valour. For your own sake, fight with him in the battle.’ Having been thus addressed, your son did not say anything in reply. He pretended not to have heard what had been said and went to the spot where Satyaki was.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3041">‘“He was accompanied by a large army of mlecchas who did not retreat. Having approached Yuyudhana in the battle, he sought to fight with him. Drona, foremost among rathas, angrily advanced against the Panchalas and the Pandavas, using a medium speed. In that battle, Drona penetrated the Panchala array. He drove away those warriors, in hundreds and thousands. O great king! Drona proclaimed his name in the battle and caused great carnage among the Pandus, Panchalas and Matsyas. The radiant Viraketu, the son of Panchala, attacked him. He pierced Drona with five arrows that had drooping tufts. He pierced his standard with one and his charioteer with another seven. O great king! What I witnessed in that encounter was extraordinary. Despite his violence, Drona could not approach Panchala in that battle. O venerable one! O king! On seeing that Drona had been checked in that battle, all the Panchalas<a id="calibre_link-603" href="#calibre_link-166" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">259</sup></a> desired the victory of Dharma’s son and surrounded him from all sides. O king! They enveloped Drona with arrows that were like fire, extremely thick javelins and many kinds of weapons. O king! But in every direction, Drona destroyed those masses of arrows, like a giant cloud in the sky, driven away by the wind. The destroyer of enemy heroes then released an extremely terrible arrow, which was like the sun and the fire, towards Viraketu’s chariot. O king! That arrow penetrated the descendant of the Panchala lineage and quickly entered the earth, like a flaming and red mountain.<a id="calibre_link-604" href="#calibre_link-167" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">260</sup></a> The descendant of the Panchala lineage swiftly fell down from the chariot, like a giant <em class="calibre4">champaka</em> tree that has been shattered by the wind and has fallen from a mountain top. When that prince, immensely strong and a great archer, was killed, the Panchalas quickly surrounded Drona from <a id="calibre_link-3042" class="calibre2"></a>every direction. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! Chitraketu, Sudhanva, Chitravarma and Chitraratha were stricken with grief on account of their brother. They attacked and unitedly fought against Bharadvaja’s son. They released showers of arrows, like clouds at the end of the summer. He was struck in many ways by these maharatha princes. Those princes were angry in the battle. But he deprived them of their horses, charioteers and chariots. The immensely illustrious one then used other extremely sharp and broad-headed arrows to sever and bring down their heads, as if he was plucking flowers. O extremely radiant king! Slain, they fell down on the ground from their chariots. They were like daityas and danavas, in the ancient battle between the gods and the asuras.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3043">‘“Those maharatha Panchalas were like the gods. On seeing that they had been killed, Dhrishtadyumna became extremely angry and tears flowed from his eyes. In that battle, he angrily advanced towards Drona’s chariot. O king!

Panchala became senseless with rage and wrathfully struck Drona in the chest with ninety arrows with drooping tufts. Bharadvaja’s powerful and immensely illustrious son was severely wounded. He lost his senses and sat down on the floor of his chariot. On seeing him in that state, the valiant Dhrishtadyumna cast aside his bow. The brave one quickly grasped a sword. O venerable one! The maharatha quickly descended from his chariot and swiftly ascended the chariot of Bharadvaja’s son. His eyes were red with rage and he wished to sever his<a id="calibre_link-606" href="#calibre_link-169" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">262</sup></a> head from his body. Meanwhile, the immensely strong Drona regained his senses and grasped a bow. O king! He pierced him with <em class="calibre4">vaitastika</em> arrows<a id="calibre_link-607" href="#calibre_link-170" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">263</sup></a> that were meant to be used for fighting at close quarters. O king! In that battle, maharatha Dhrishtadyumna was struck by <a id="calibre_link-3044" class="calibre2"></a>vaitastika arrows that are meant for fighting at close quarters. These were known to Drona and they weakened Dhrishtadyumna. Having been struck by many such arrows, the immensely strong one quickly descended from the chariot. The brave one’s speed had been baffled. The brave one ascended his own chariot and grasped a giant bow. In that encounter, maharatha Dhrishtadyumna pierced Drona. O great king! The clash between them was marvellous and large numbers of beings applauded it, the kshatriyas, as well as other soldiers present there. O king! The Panchalas loudly exclaimed, ‘There is no doubt that, having engaged in this encounter, Drona will be subjugated by Dhrishtadyumna.’ In that battle, Drona quickly brought down the head of Dhrishtadyumna’s charioteer, like a ripe fruit from a tree. O king! The great-souled one’s horses ran away. When they had run away in the battle,<a id="calibre_link-608" href="#calibre_link-171" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">264</sup></a> the powerful one drove away the Panchalas and the Srinjayas. Bharadvaja’s powerful son defeated the Pandus and the Panchalas. The scorcher of enemies re-established his vyuha and stationed himself there. O lord! The Pandavas evinced no interest in defeating him in the battle.”’</p>

He<a id="calibre_link-609" href="#calibre_link-172" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">265</sup></a> was like Mount Mainaka. The brave one covered Duhshasana with a severe storm of arrows.

Those performers of evil deeds approached near Yuyudhana. There were three thousand Trigartas, skilled in fighting. They surrounded him with a large army of chariots. They had resolved to fight and had sworn to be samshaptakas.<a id="calibre_link-612" href="#calibre_link-175" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">268</sup></a> They advanced in that battle and released showers of arrows. Five hundred foremost warriors were stationed at the forefront of that array. But the supreme one of the Shini lineage quickly uprooted, brought down and killed them with his arrows. They were like giant trees that had been shattered by the force of a violent wind. O lord of the earth! Many chariots and standards were shattered. Horses with golden harnesses fell down on the ground. O great king! The arrows released by Shini’s descendant made them flow with blood and they were as beautiful as flowering kimshukas. In that battle, those on your side were slaughtered by Yuyudhana. They could not find a protector, like elephants that have sunk into a swamp. All of them fled towards Drona’s chariot. They were like giant serpents, penetrating a hole, because of fear of the king of the birds.<a id="calibre_link-613" href="#calibre_link-176" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">269</sup></a> The brave one killed five hundred warriors with arrows that were like venomous serpents and then slowly advanced towards Dhananjaya’s chariot.</p>

O great king! O descendant of the Bharata lineage! Duhshasana laughed and pierced Satyaki with three arrows, and yet again with five. Shini’s descendant pierced your son with five arrows. In that battle, he severed his bow and while smiling, proceeded towards Arjuna. Duhshasana became angry. As the brave one from the Vrishni lineage was proceeding, he wished to kill him and hurled a javelin that was entirely made out of iron at him. O king! Your son hurled that terrible javelin. But Satyaki used sharp arrows tufted with heron feathers to shatter <a id="calibre_link-3049" class="calibre2"></a>it into a hundred fragments. O lord of men! Your son then grasped another bow. He pierced Satyaki with ten arrows and roared like a lion. In that encounter, Satyaki became enraged and confounded your son. He struck him between the breasts with arrows that were like the flames of fires. He again pierced him with ten sharp and pointed arrows that were completely made out of iron. Duhshasana pierced Satyaki back with twenty arrows. O great king! Satvata pierced him between the breasts with three arrows that were extremely powerful and had drooping tufts. The maharatha used some sharp arrows to kill his mounts and extremely angry, slew his charioteer with arrows with drooping tufts. He severed his bow with a broad-headed arrow and his arm-guard with another five. The one who was skilled in the use of supreme weapons then used a couple of broad-headed arrows to sever his standard and the pole of his chariot. He then used sharp arrows to bring down the two parshnis. His<a id="calibre_link-615" href="#calibre_link-178" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">271</sup></a> bow was severed. He was without a chariot. His horses were slain. His charioteer was killed. The general of the Trigartas then picked him up on his own chariot. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! Shini’s descendant followed him for some time. But remembering Bhimasena’s words, the mighty-armed one did not kill him. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! In the assembly hall and in everyone’s presence, Bhimasena had sworn to kill your sons in battle. O lord! O king! Thus did Satyaki vanquish Duhshasana in that encounter and quickly proceeded along Dhananjaya’s route.”’</p>

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3051">‘Dhritarashtra asked, “Were there no maharathas among my soldiers who could kill or stop Satyaki on his journey? Truth is his valour. In that battle, he single-handedly accomplished deeds that were like those of the great Indra against the danavas. In a battle, he <a id="calibre_link-3052" class="calibre2"></a>was Shakra’s equal in strength. Or is it the case that Satyaki’s route was empty? Single-handedly, the bull among men drove away many soldiers. How did Shini’s great-souled descendant single-handedly overcome the many who attacked him and wished to fight with him? O Sanjaya! Tell me all this.”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3053">‘Sanjaya replied, “O king! The soldiers prepared themselves, with chariots, elephants, horses and infantry. Your soldiers were tremendous and it was like the end of a yuga. O one who gives honours! Your entire army was assembled. It is my view that an assemblage like this has never been seen in the world. O lord of the earth! The gods and the assembled charanas said, ‘A vyuha like the one Drona has formed at the time of Jayadratha’s death will never again be seen.’ There was a terrible roar, like that of the oceans. In that battle, those large numbers of soldiers rushed against each other in waves. O supreme among men! There were many kings, hundreds and thousands, who had assembled on your side and that of the Pandavas. Those brave ones were angry. They were the performers of firm deeds in battle. A great and tumultuous sound arose and it made the body hair stand up. O venerable one! Bhimasena, Dhrishtadyumna, Nakula, Sahadeva and Pandava Dharmaraja exclaimed, ‘Come. Strike. Attack with force. The brave Madhava and Pandava have penetrated into the forces of the enemy. Swiftly act, so that they can advance towards Jayadratha’s death with ease.’ Thus did they urge the soldiers. ‘If they are vanquished, the Kurus will have succeeded in their objective and we will have been been defeated. Unite and quickly agitate this ocean of soldiers, like extremely forceful winds against the ocean.’ O king! They were goaded by Bhimasena and Panchala.<a id="calibre_link-616" href="#calibre_link-179" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">272</sup></a> In the battle, they killed the Kouravas, ready to give up their beloved lives. They were greatly energetic and desired death from weapons in that battle, for the sake of heaven and for the sake of their friends. They were not interested in protecting their lives. O king! In similar fashion, those on your side desired great fame. The noble ones desired to fight and remained stationed in the battle. A tumultuous battle commenced and it gave rise to great fear. Having <a id="calibre_link-3054" class="calibre2"></a>killed all the soldiers, Satyaki proceeded towards Arjuna. In every direction in that battle, the colourful rays of the sun illuminated the armour and rebuffed the sight of the soldiers who sought to strike back. O great king! In similar fashion, without any fear, Duryodhana made efforts to immerse himself in the great army of the Pandaveyas. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! There was a fierce clash between them and him. There was a great destruction among all the soldiers.”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3055">‘Dhritarashtra said, “O charioteer! When he advanced against those soldiers, he must himself have confronted great hardships. I hope he did not turn his back on the battle.

<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3056">‘Sanjaya replied, “O king! O descendant of the Bharata lineage! Listen to the extraordinary battle that your son fought, one against many. Listen. I will describe it. In that battle, Duryodhana suddenly descended on the Pandava soldiers and agitated them like an elephant, as if he was an elephant among lotuses. O Kourava! On seeing that your son was acting in this way against the army, the Panchalas, with Bhimasena at the forefront, attacked. He<a id="calibre_link-618" href="#calibre_link-181" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">274</sup></a> pierced Bhimasena with ten arrows, each of Madri’s sons with three, Virata and Drupada with six each and Shikhandi with one hundred. He pierced Dhrishtadyumna with twenty, Dharma’s son with seven, the Kekayas with ten and each of Droupadi’s sons with three arrows. In that battle, like an angry Yama against beings, he used his fierce arrows to bring down hundreds of other warriors, elephants and rathas. As he affixed and released arrows, his bow was seen to be stretched into a continuous circle. He killed the enemy with the skill and strength of his weapons. He killed the foes with his giant bow that possessed a golden back. O venerable one! The eldest of the <a id="calibre_link-3057" class="calibre2"></a>Pandavas<a id="calibre_link-619" href="#calibre_link-182" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">275</sup></a> used a couple of broad-headed arrows to sever his bow into three fragments and pierced him with many sharp and excellent arrows. But having touched the armour, they shattered and penetrated the earth. The delighted Parthas surrounded Yudhishthira, like the rejoicing gods and maharshis around Shakra, when Vritra had been killed. At this, King Duryodhana picked up a firmer bow and asked the Pandava king to wait. When your maharatha son spoke and advanced against the king, the Panchalas, desiring victory, cheerfully counter-attacked. Wishing to protect him,<a id="calibre_link-620" href="#calibre_link-183" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">276</sup></a> Drona received the warring Pandavas. He was like a mountain receiving rain from a cloud that has been stirred up by a violent wind. O king! There was a loud noise in that battle and it rose above everything else.

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3059">‘Sanjaya said, “O great king! In the afternoon, there was again an encounter between Drona and the Somakas. It was accompanied by a sound that was like that of clouds thundering. The foremost among men<a id="calibre_link-621" href="#calibre_link-184" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">277</sup></a> was stationed on a chariot with red horses. He attacked the Pandus in that battle, resorting to a medium speed. The immensely strong and great archer was engaged in what would bring you pleasure. He was born from a supreme pot.<a id="calibre_link-622" href="#calibre_link-185" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">278</sup></a> O descendant of the Bharata lineage! He used sharp arrows with colourful tufts and struck down the best of warriors. O king! Bharadvaja’s powerful son seemed to be sporting in that battle.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3060">‘“Maharatha Brihatkshatra from Kekaya, the eldest of five brothers and brave and indomitable in battle, advanced against him. <a id="calibre_link-3061" class="calibre2"></a>He released sharp arrows and severely shrouded the preceptor. He was like a mighty cloud that releases rain on Gandhamadana. O great king! At this, Drona became extremely angry. He released seventeen arrows that were gold-tufted and had been sharpened on stone. Those terrible arrows were released from Drona’s bow and were like venomous serpents. However, in the battle, he cheerfully sliced down each of them with ten of his own arrows. On beholding his dexterity, the best of the brahmanas laughed and dispatched eight arrows that had drooping tufts. On seeing these arrows released from Drona’s bow swiftly descend on him, he severed those arrows with firm and sharp arrows of his own. O great king! Your soldiers were astounded at this. They beheld Brihatkshatra perform an extremely difficult deed. O great king! Drona also applauded Kekaya’s special act. In that battle, the greatly ascetic one then invoked the divine and invincible brahmastra. O king! But in that battle, the mighty-armed Kekaya released his own brahmastra and countered it. Having destroyed the weapon of Bharadvaja’s son in that encounter, he pierced the brahmana with sixty arrows with gold tufts that had been sharpened on stone. At this, Drona, best among men, released an iron arrow. O supreme among kings! This penetrated his armour and entered the ground, like a cobra penetrating a termite hill when it is released. In that battle, the arrow penetrated Kekaya and entered the earth. O great king! He was thus severely pierced by Drona, knowledgeable about weapons, and became overcome by great rage. He dilated his beautiful eyes and pierced Drona with seventy arrows that were gold-tufted and had been sharpened on stone. With a broad-headed arrow, he struck the charioteer in the arms and the chest. O venerable one! Pierced by Brihatkshatra in many ways, Drona released many sharp arrows towards Kekaya’s chariot. Drona made maharatha Brihatkshatra anxious. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! O great king! He released sharp arrows towards Kekaya and quickly struck him severely between the breasts. The heart of that tiger among men was shattered and he fell down from his chariot.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3062">‘“O king! On the death of the maharatha from Kekaya, Shishupala’s son became extremely angry and spoke to his charioteer. ‘O charioteer! Go to the spot where the armoured Drona is stationed <a id="calibre_link-3063" class="calibre2"></a>and is slaughtering all the Kekayas and the Panchalas and their armies.’ On hearing his words, the charioteer took the supreme of rathas to Drona, on swift horses that hailed from Kamboja. Dhrishtaketu, bull among the Chedi lineage was extremely proud of his strength and suddenly attacked Drona, like an insect towards a flame. Having attacked, he pierced Drona, his horses, his chariot and his standard with sixty arrows. He again used other sharp arrows, as if against a sleeping tiger. As the powerful king endeavoured in the battle, Drona used a sharp kshurapra arrow to sever his bow in the middle. Shishupala’s maharatha son picked up another bow. He again pierced Drona with extremely sharp and firm arrows. The immensely strong Drona killed his horses and his charioteer and pierced him with twenty-five arrows. In that battle, the king of the Chedis was without a chariot and without his bow. He angrily hurled a club towards the chariot of Bharadvaja’s son. It was terrible in form and fearsome. It was heavy, completely made out of stone and embellished with gold. On seeing it suddenly descend, Bharadvaja’s son brought it down with many thousands of arrows. Bharadvaja’s son used arrows to bring the club down onto the ground, like a star with a red garland of clouds falling down from the sky. On seeing that the club had been destroyed, the intolerant Dhrishtaketu quickly hurled a javelin and a spear that was as bright as gold. In that great battle, Drona used his arrows to shatter the javelin into three pieces. Using his lightness of hand, the immensely strong one also violently severed the spear. He<a id="calibre_link-623" href="#calibre_link-186" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">279</sup></a> was trying to kill him. In that encounter, Bharadvaja’s powerful son wished to kill him instead and released an extremely sharp arrow. The arrow penetrated the armour and the heart of the infinitely energetic one and then penetrated the ground, like a swan entering a pond full of lotuses. O king! Just as an insect is grasped by a hungry blue jay, in that great battle, the brave Drona devoured Dhrishtaketu. When the king of Chedi was killed, his son wished to take up his father’s burden. The son was supreme in the knowledge of weapons and was overcome by intolerance. But Drona laughed at him and used his arrows to dispatch him to Yama’s eternal <a id="calibre_link-3064" class="calibre2"></a>abode. The powerful one was like a huge tiger in a large forest, against a young deer.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3065">‘“O descendant of the Bharata lineage! The Pandavas were thus being decimated. Jarasandha’s brave son himself attacked Drona. O great king! He enveloped Drona with his sharp arrows and swiftly made him invisible, like the sun by clouds. On seeing his dexterity, Drona, the destroyer of kshatriyas, quickly released hundreds and thousands of arrows. In that encounter, Drona, supreme among rathas, remained stationed on his chariot. While all the enemy archers looked on, he enveloped and killed Jarasandha’s son.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3066">‘“Drona was like Death and devoured whoever dared to approach Drona. He was like death, which grasps all beings when the right time has come. Drona, the great archer, proclaimed his name in that battle. He released many thousands of arrows and stupefied the Pandaveyas. These arrows were gold-tufted, sharpened on stone and were marked with Drona’s name. In that battle, in every direction, he slew men, elephants and horses. They were slaughtered by Drona, like Shakra against the great asuras. The Panchalas trembled, like cows afflicted by the cold. O bull among the Bharata lineage! When the soldiers were thus slaughtered by Drona, a terrible uproar arose among the Pandavas. In that encounter, they were confounded by the shower of arrows released by Bharadvaja’s son. The maharatha Panchalas were like those whose thighs had been grasped by crocodiles. O great king! The Chedis, the Srinjayas and the Somakas sought to cheerfully fight against Bharadvaja’s son and attacked, shouting, ‘Drona has been slain. Drona has been slain.’ Those tigers among men used their utmost strength against the immensely radiant one. In that encounter, they wished to dispatch Drona to Yama’s abode. While those brave ones strove, Bharadvaja’s son used arrows that had been sharpened on stone to send them, especially the foremost among the Chedis, to Yama. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! On seeing what had become to the foremost among the Chedis, the Panchalas trembled and were oppressed by Drona’s arrows. O venerable one! On witnessing Drona’s form and deeds, they loudly called out, in the direction of Bhimasena and Dhrishtadyumna’s chariots, ‘There is no doubt that this brahmana has performed austerities that are difficult <a id="calibre_link-3067" class="calibre2"></a>to perform and his conduct is great. He is valiant in the battle and is consuming the bulls among the kshatriyas. Fighting is the dharma of kshatriyas and supreme austerities that of brahmanas. But an ascetic who is accomplished in learning can burn with his sight. Drona’s weapons are like fire to the touch and are penetrating the bulls among the kshatriyas. O descendant of the Bharata lineage!<a id="calibre_link-624" href="#calibre_link-187" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">280</sup></a> There are many who have approached this unassailable and terrible one and have been consumed. The immensely radiant one is using the utmost of his strength, the utmost of his endeavour and the utmost of his spirits. Drona is killing our soldiers and is confounding all the beings.’ Kshatradharma was stationed there and heard these words.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3068">‘“He used an arrow that was in the shape of a half-moon to sever Drona’s bow, with an arrow affixed to it. Drona, the crusher of kshatriyas, became even more enraged. He grasped another radiant bow that was even more forceful. He affixed a sharp arrow to it, one that sparkled, was firm and was capable of destroying a great load. The powerful preceptor pulled the bow back up to his ear and released it. This killed Kshatradharma and penetrated the earth. His heart was shattered and he fell down from the chariot, onto the ground. On the death of Dhrishtadyumna’s son, the other soldiers trembled.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3069">‘“Maharatha Chekitana then attacked Drona and pierced Drona between the breasts with ten arrows. He used four more to strike his charioteer and four arrows to strike the four horses. The preceptor then pierced his right arm with sixteen arrows, his standard with sixteen arrows and his charioteer with seven. When his charioteer was slain, the horses fled, dragging the chariot away, since in that encounter, they were covered with the arrows of Bharadvaja’s son. O venerable one! On seeing that Chekitana’s chariot had fled and that his charioteer had been slain, the Panchalas and the Pandavas were overcome by a great fear. O venerable one! In every direction of that battle, Drona drove away the assemblage of brave Chedis, Panchalas and Srinjayas and looked extremely beautiful. His grey hair descended up to his ears. He was dark. He was more than eighty <a id="calibre_link-3070" class="calibre2"></a>years old. But in that battle, the aged Drona roamed around like one who was only sixteen years old. O great king. As Drona, the destroyer of enemies, fearlessly roamed around in that battle, the enemy regarded him as the one with the vajra in his hand.<a id="calibre_link-625" href="#calibre_link-188" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">281</sup></a></p>

Hundreds of them are lying down on the ground, like wounded bulls. Their limbs are covered with blood and they have become food for dogs and jackals.’ O great king! Having said this, Drupada, the leader of an akshouhini, attacked Drona in that battle, placing the Parthas in front of him.”’</p>

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3073">‘Sanjaya said, “The vyuha of the Pandavas was thus being agitated in every direction. The Parthas, the Panchalas and the Somakas retreated a great distance away. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! A terrible encounter commenced and it made the body hair stand up, like the fierce one that causes the destruction of the universe at the end of a yuga. The powerful Drona roared repeatedly in that battle. When the Panchalas and the Pandus were being slaughtered and decimated in that encounter, Dharmaraja Yudhishthira could not see what should be done. O Indra among kings! He began to think about what might transpire. He looked in all the directions, in the hope of seeing Savyasachi. But Yudhishthira could not see either Partha or Madhava. He could not see that tiger among men, the one with the bull among apes on his banner. Nor could he hear Gandiva’s roar and his senses were overcome with dejection. Nor did <a id="calibre_link-3074" class="calibre2"></a>he see Satyaki, the foremost of rathas among the Vrishnis. Because of these thoughts, Dharmaraja Yudhishthira’s limbs became weak. Not being able to see those two bulls among men,<a id="calibre_link-626" href="#calibre_link-189" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">282</sup></a> he could not find any peace. The immensely illustrious Dharmaraja was afraid that the world would censure him. The mighty-armed one began to think about the chariot of Shini’s descendant. ‘In the battle, I sent him to follow Phalguna’s footsteps. Satyaki, Shini’s descendant, is truly someone who dispels the fears of his friends. Earlier, I only had one reason for anxiety and now there are two. I should have news about both Satyaki and Pandava Dhananjaya. I sent Satyaki to follow Pandava’s footsteps. In this battle, whom will I send to follow in Satvata’s footsteps? If I make efforts to only obtain tidings of my brother and ignore Yuyudhana, the worlds will censure me and say that Dharmaraja Yudhishthira acted only to search for his brother and abandoned Varshneya Satyaki, for whom truth is valour. I am scared of the censure of the world. Therefore, I will send Partha Vrikodara in the footsteps of the great-souled Madhava. The love that I have for Arjuna, the destroyer of enemies, is the same as the one I bear towards Satvata, the brave one from the Vrishni lineage, who is invincible in battle. I have imposed an extremely heavy burden on Shini’s descendant. Because of a friend’s request, and to enhance his glory, the immensely strong one has penetrated the army of the Bharatas, like a makara in an ocean. I hear a loud noise from the brave ones, who have not retreated and have united to fight against the intelligent and brave one from the Vrishni lineage. It is certain that they are too many and too strong. It seems to me that the time has come for the archer, Pandava Bhimasena, to go to the spot where those two maharathas are. There is nothing on this earth that Bhima cannot withstand. In a battle, he can make efforts and stand up to all the archers on earth. Resorting to the strength of his own arms, he can stand up to all enemies. All of us have resorted to that great-souled one’s strength of arms and have returned from the exile in the forest, without being vanquished in a battle. If Bhimasena goes towards Satvata and Pandava, both Satvata and Phalguna will find <a id="calibre_link-3075" class="calibre2"></a>a protector in the battle. They have Vasudeva himself as a protector and are skilled in the use of weapons. However, I must be certain and dispel the anxiety. Therefore, I will appoint Bhimasena to follow in Satvata’s footsteps. Having done this, I think that I will have made arrangements for Satyaki’s protection.’ O king! Having thus made up his mind, Yudhishthira, Dharma’s son, asked his charioteer to take him to Bhima.</p>

Having reached Bhimasena, the king remembered the occasion and overcome by dejection, entreated him in many ways. ‘He conquered the gods, the gandharvas and the daityas on a single chariot. O Bhimasena! But I do not see the standard of your younger brother.’ Bhimasena spoke to Dharmaraja, who had arrived there. ‘Never before have I seen, or heard, you overcome by such grief. In earlier times, when we were afflicted by dejection, you were the one who assured us. O Indra among king! Arise! Arise and instruct me about what should be done. O one who gives honours! There is no task that I cannot accomplish. O foremost among the Kuru lineage! Command me and do not have this sorrow in your mind.’ The king’s face was cheerless.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3077">‘“He sighed like a cobra and spoke these words to Bhimasena, his voice choking with tears. ‘The blare of the conch shell Panchajanya can be heard, as it is being sounded by an angry and illustrious Vasudeva. It is certain that Dhananjaya, your brother, has now been killed and is lying down. With him slain, it is certain that Janardana is fighting now. The Pandavas obtain their lives on his spirit and his valour.<a id="calibre_link-627" href="#calibre_link-190" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">283</sup></a> When we are in fear, we turn towards him, like the immortals towards the one with the thousand eyes.<a id="calibre_link-628" href="#calibre_link-191" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">284</sup></a> The brave one has gone in search of Saindhava and has penetrated the army of the Bharatas. O Bhima! We know about his going and he will not return. Gudakesha is dark and youthful. He is handsome and mighty-armed. He has a broad chest and giant shoulders. He is <a id="calibre_link-3078" class="calibre2"></a>like a crazy elephant in his valour. His eyes are coppery, like those of a partridge,<a id="calibre_link-629" href="#calibre_link-192" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">285</sup></a> and extend the fear of the enemies. O fortunate one! O destroyer of enemies! That is the reason for my sorrow. O mighty-armed one! It is because of Arjuna and because of Satvata that my anxiety increases, like a blazing fire into which oblations are repeatedly poured. I cannot see his standard and that is the reason I am afflicted by misery. Know maharatha Satvata to be a tiger among men. That maharatha has followed in the footsteps of your younger brother. O mighty-armed one! I cannot see him and that is the reason I am afflicted by misery. That is the reason Krishna, skilled in fighting, is certainly fighting in this encounter, because that brave one and the valiant Pandava, are no longer alive. O Kounteya! Therefore, if you think this to be your duty, go where Dhananjaya and the immensely valorous Satyaki have gone. O one who knows about dharma! These are my words and I am your elder brother. Know what should be known, that Satyaki is just like Arjuna to you. O Partha! To do that which will bring me pleasure, he has followed Savyasachi. Those tracks are difficult to traverse and terrible. They cannot be followed by those who have not cleansed their souls.’</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3079">‘“Bhimasena replied, ‘There is a chariot that bore Brahma, Ishana,<a id="calibre_link-630" href="#calibre_link-193" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">286</sup></a> Indra and Varuna earlier. The two Krishnas have departed on that and they have no reason for fear. But I will bear your words on my head and go. Do not grieve. I will meet those tigers among men and give them your message.’”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3080">‘Sanjaya said, “Having spoken those words, he prepared to depart. He repeatedly handed over Yudhishthira to Dhrishtadyumna and the other powerful well-wishers. The greatly powerful Bhimasena spoke to Dhrishtadyumna. ‘O mighty-armed one! You know that maharatha Drona will use every means at his disposal to seize Dharmaraja. O Parshata! Once I am gone, there is no task as important to you, and to all of us, as that of protecting the king. Partha has spoken to me in this way and I cannot venture to contradict him. I will therefore go to the spot where Saindhava, who is about to face death, is stationed. <a id="calibre_link-3081" class="calibre2"></a>It is my duty to unhesitatingly follow Dharmaraja’s words. In the battle today, make every effort to protect Partha Yudhishthira. In the encounter, this is the most important of all your tasks.’ O great king! Thus addressed by Vrikodara, Dhrishtadyumna replied, ‘O Partha! I will do as you desire. Go without any hesitation. Without killing Dhrishtadyumna in the battle, Drona will not be able to seize Dharmaraja, regardless of what efforts he makes in the encounter.’ Pandava thus handed over the king to Dhrishtadyumna. He showed his obeisance to his elder and his senior and went towards Phalguna. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! Kounteya was embraced by Dharmaraja, who inhaled the fragrance of his head and pronounced sacred benedictions over him. The mighty-armed Bhimasena was attired in armour and beautiful earrings. The supreme of rathas had armlets and body-armour and arrows. The immensely intelligent one had armour that was made out of black iron and was decorated with gold. He was as beautiful as a cloud tinged with lightning, adorning a mountain. He was well decorated in garments that were yellow, red and white. There was armour around his neck. He was as beautiful as a cloud adorned with Indra’s weapon.<a id="calibre_link-631" href="#calibre_link-194" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">287</sup></a> O lord of the earth! As Bhimasena was about to set out, to fight with your soldiers, Panchajanya’s terrible blare was heard again. On hearing that terrible roar, the three worlds were struck with great fear. Dharma’s mighty-armed son again spoke to Bhima. ‘The foremost one from the Vrishni lineage is blowing fiercely on his conch shell. The king of conch shells is resounding on earth and in heaven. There is no doubt that Savyasachi confronts a great hardship and the wielder of the chakra and the club<a id="calibre_link-632" href="#calibre_link-195" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">288</sup></a> is fighting with all the Kurus. There is no doubt that the immensely noble Kunti, Droupadi and Subhadra, together with their relatives, are witnessing evil omens now. O Bhima! Swiftly go to the spot where Dhananjaya is. O Partha! I wish to see Dhananjaya and all the directions and the sub-directions are benumbed because of that, and on Satvata’s account. Go. Leave!’ Thus did he again address Bhimasena. Severely urged by the brother, the brother who <a id="calibre_link-3082" class="calibre2"></a>always had the brother’s welfare in mind,<a id="calibre_link-633" href="#calibre_link-196" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">289</sup></a> caused battle drums to be sounded. Bhima blew on his conch shell. He roared like a lion and repeatedly stretched his bow. He displayed his terrible self and suddenly dashed against the enemy.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3083">‘“The supreme horses were obedient and fast. They were controlled by Vishoka<a id="calibre_link-634" href="#calibre_link-197" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">290</sup></a> and possessed the speed of the mind and the wind. They bore him instantly. With his hands, Partha rubbed the string of his bow and stretched it. He crushed and agitated the head of that army. As the mighty-armed one advanced, the brave Panchalas and the Somakas followed him with their soldiers, like the immortals after Maghavan. O great king! The brothers Duhshala, Chitrasena, Kundabhedi, Vivimshati, Durmukha, Duhsaha, Vikarna, Shala, Vinda, Anuvinda,<a id="calibre_link-635" href="#calibre_link-198" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">291</sup></a> Sumukha, Dirghabahu, Sudarshana, Vrindaraka, Suhasta, Sushena, Dirghalochana, Abhaya, Roudrakarma, Suvarma, Durvimochana and many foremost among rathas, with their soldiers and followers, united and attacked the brave Bhimasena in that battle. On seeing them, the powerful Kounteya Bhimasena forcefully advanced against them, like a lion against small animals. The brave ones there exhibited great and divine weapons and countered Bhima with their arrows, like clouds shrouding a sun that has arisen. But he forcefully passed through them and attacked Drona’s array. He showered down arrows on the array of elephants that was in front of him. In a short while, the son of the wind god swiftly drove away that army of elephants in all the directions and pierced them. Terrified by those arrows, they roared, like deer in a forest. All the elephants fled, shrieking in fierce tones. He forcefully passed through them, and again attacked Drona’s array.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3084">‘“The preceptor checked him, like the shoreline against an advancing ocean. He smiled and struck him on the forehead with an iron arrow. Pandava was resplendent there, like the sun when it casts its rays upwards. The preceptor thought that Bhima would show him reverence and worship him, as Phalguna had done earlier <a id="calibre_link-3085" class="calibre2"></a>and spoke to Vrikodara. ‘O Bhimasena! O immensely strong one! In the midst of the enemy, without vanquishing me in battle, you are incapable of penetrating into the hostile forces. With my permission, your younger brother and Krishna penetrated earlier. But you are incapable of penetrating into this array.’ On hearing the words of his preceptor, Bhima was not scared and sighing, spoke to Drona, his eyes coppery red with anger. ‘O blind brahmana! In this field of battle, it cannot be that Arjuna has penetrated with your permission. He is invincible, even against one of Shakra’s special army. If he showed you supreme worship, that was only for the sake of honouring you. But I am not Arjuna. O Drona! I am the angry Bhimasena, your enemy. We look upon you as our father, our preceptor and our relative, and ourselves as your sons. Thinking in this way, all of us have always bowed down before you. But it is evident that you have uttered contrary words against us today. If you think of yourself as our enemy, let it be that way. If you are like an enemy, Bhima will perform the task that he has to do.’ O king! Saying this, Bhima whirled a club that was like Yama’s staff and hurled it towards Drona, who leapt down from his chariot. It uprooted Drona’s horses, charioteer, standard and chariot and crushed many other warriors with its energy, like the wind among the trees. The supreme ratha was again surrounded by your sons. Drona, supreme among warriors, ascended another chariot. O great king! The powerful Bhimasena became angry and enveloped the array of chariots that was in front of him with a shower of arrows. Your maharatha sons were struck in that battle. Bhima, whose strength was terrible, fought with the warriors who were desirous of victory.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3086">‘“Wishing to kill the descendant of the Pandu lineage, Duhshasana angrily grasped a javelin and hurled it.<a id="calibre_link-636" href="#calibre_link-199" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">292</sup></a> It was sharp and was completely made out of iron. Thus released by your son, that giant javelin descended. Bhima sliced it into two fragments and it was wonderful. The angry and powerful one then used three arrows to <a id="calibre_link-3087" class="calibre2"></a>kill Kundabhedi, Sushena and Dirghanetra. Among your brave sons who were fighting, he again slew the valiant Vrindaraka, the extender of the deeds of the Kuru lineage. Bhima again killed three of your sons with three arrows, Abhaya, Roudrakarma and Durvimochana. O great king! Your sons were thus slaughtered by the powerful Bhima, supreme among strikers, and surrounded him from all sides. Kounteya laughed and used other arrows to send your sons, Vinda, Anuvinda and Survarmana to Yama’s abode. O bull among the Bharata lineage! Your valiant son, Sudarshana, was quickly pierced in that battle and fell down dead. Within a short period of time, the descendant of the Pandu lineage quickly shattered that army of chariots and drove it away in all the directions. O lord of the earth! They were like deer frightened at the roar of the chariot. Your sons were slaughtered in that battle. All those rathas were afflicted by their fear of Bhimasena and ran away. Kounteya followed that large army of your sons. O king! In that encounter, he pierced the Kouravas from every direction. O great king! Those on your side were killed by Bhimasena. They abandoned Bhima and urging their supreme horses, fled from the battle. The immensely strong Bhimasena vanquished them in that encounter. Pandava roared like a lion and slapped his arms. The immensely strong Bhima made a loud noise with his palms. He passed through those rathas and attacked Drona’s array.”’</p>

He attacked the brothers<a id="calibre_link-637" href="#calibre_link-200" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">293</sup></a> and confounded them with his strength. In that battle, those supreme archers were urged <a id="calibre_link-3090" class="calibre2"></a>to adopt the greatest force by your sons and surrounded him from all sides. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! Having been thus surrounded, Bhima laughed. He raised a terrible club, and roaring like a lion, hurled it at them. The powerful one released it with force and it crushed them. It was as if Indra’s vajra had been hurled by Indra and struck them firmly. O king! Its loud noise seemed to fill up the earth. Its terrible and flaming energy frightened your sons. On seeing that it was descending with great force, covered in energy, all those on your side fled, roaring in lamentation. O venerable one! Its sound was impossible to tolerate. Many men fell down where they stood and so did rathas on chariots. Kounteya, unassailable to enemies, drove them away in that encounter. His force against that army was like that of Suparna,<a id="calibre_link-638" href="#calibre_link-201" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">294</sup></a> the king of the birds.

In that battle, Drona checked Bhima with his arrows and suddenly emitted a loud roar, terrifying the Pandus. O great king! An extremely terrible battle commenced between Drona and the great-souled Bhima, like that between the gods and the asuras. Sharp arrows were released from Drona’s bow and in that encounter, these slew brave ones in hundreds and thousands. Pandava descended from his chariot with great force. O king! He closed his eyes and attacked Drona on foot, like a bull receiving rain with ease. Thus did Bhima, tiger among men, receive that shower of arrows. The immensely strong one grasped the pole<a id="calibre_link-639" href="#calibre_link-202" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">295</sup></a> with his hands and hurled it. O king! Drona was quickly thrown down by Bhima in that battle. He mounted another chariot and stationed himself at the mouth of the vyuha. At that time, his charioteer quickly urged the horses. O Kouravya! Bhimasena’s act was extraordinary. The immensely strong Bhimasena mounted his own chariot and powerfully attacked your son’s army. He crushed the kshatriyas, like a gale uprooting trees. He advanced against the enemy soldiers like a mountain against the force of the waters. He encountered the army of the Bhojas, protected by Hardikya. O king! <a id="calibre_link-3092" class="calibre2"></a>Bhimasena crushed it in many ways and advanced. O venerable one! He frightened the enemy soldiers by slapping his palms. He could not be defeated by any of those soldiers, like a tiger by a herd of bulls.

Bhimasena wished to see Dhananjaya. In that battle, the descendant of the Pandu lineage passed through all your warriors. He then saw Arjuna, bull among men, fighting there bravely. The valiant one was striving for Saindhava’s death. Having seen Arjuna there, he let out a mighty roar. O Kouravya! That mighty roar was heard by Partha. Partha<a id="calibre_link-640" href="#calibre_link-203" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">296</sup></a> also let out a mighty roar and so did Madhava. O great king! They attacked like bulls.

Having heard Bhimasena’s roar and that of the archer Phalguna, Yudhishthira, Dharma’s son, rejoiced. On hearing those loud roars, the king’s sorrow was dispelled. The lord became assured about Dhananjaya’s victory in the battle. While Bhimasena, fierce in battle, was roaring, the mighty-armed Yudhishthira, Dharma’s son, smiled.</p>

Protected by Vasudeva, will he be able to fulfil his promise? Will I meet Arjuna before the sun has set? Saindhava has always been engaged in ensuring King Duryodhana’s welfare. Will he be brought down by Phalguna and delight his enemies? Will King Duryodhana be brought down by Phalguna?

Karna, the great archer, shot four more arrows. O king! But before they could reach him Bhima displayed the dexterity of his hands and used arrows with drooping tufts to slice them down into many fragments. At this, Karna enveloped him with many torrents of arrows. The descendant of Pandu’s lineage was shrouded by Karna in many ways. However, the maharatha severed Karna’s bow in his hand and pierced him with many arrows with drooping tufts. The son of the suta picked up another bow and strung it. The maharatha, the performer of terrible deeds, pierced Bhima in that encounter. Bhima became extremely angry. He powerfully struck the son of the suta in the chest with three arrows with drooping tufts. With those arrows stuck to his breast, Karna looked beautiful. O bull among the Bharata lineage! He was like a mountain with three peaks. Pierced by those supreme arrows, blood began to flow from him, like minerals and red chalk flowing from the slope of a mountain. Severely struck, Karna wavered a little. O venerable one! He then fixed an arrow to his bow and pierced Bhima. He again shot hundreds and thousands of arrows. He was suddenly enveloped by Karna, the one with the firm bow.

I will restrain the assembled Panchalas, Pandus and Srinjayas.’”</p>

O great king! Those two had earlier been contained by Kritavarma. O king! They were in search of Arjuna, who had penetrated your army in a desire to fight. Duryodhana engaged in a supreme battle with those two. The powerful descendant of the Bharata lineage quickly engaged with those two spirited brothers. Those foremost of kshatriyas were known as maharathas. They raised their bows and attacked him. Yudhamanyu was extremely angry.<a id="calibre_link-655" href="#calibre_link-218" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">311</sup></a> He quickly released arrows and pierced your son between the breasts with thirty arrows. O Indra among kings! Duryodhana killed the four horses of the infinitely energetic Panchala and also his two parshnis. With his horses and his charioteer slain in that battle, Yudhamanyu climbed onto his brother’s chariot. When he had ascended his brother’s chariot, he struck Duryodhana’s horses with many arrows. They were killed and fell down on the ground. In that encounter, when the horses were killed, Yudhamanyu quickly used a supreme arrow to sever his<a id="calibre_link-656" href="#calibre_link-219" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">312</sup></a> bow and arm-guard. When the horses and charioteer were slain, your maharatha son descended from the chariot. He grasped a club and attacked the Panchalas. On seeing that enraged destroyer of enemy cities descend, Yudhamanyu and Uttamouja jumped down from the terrace of the chariot. That supreme chariot was decorated in gold. In that encounter, he<a id="calibre_link-657" href="#calibre_link-220" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">313</sup></a> used the club to smash the chariot down onto the ground, with its horses, charioteer and standard. Though he killed them, your son’s horses had also been killed. His charioteer had been slain. The scorcher of enemies swiftly ascended the chariot of the king of Madra. Those two immensely strong princes, the foremost among the Panchalas, also climbed onto another chariot and advanced towards Dhananjaya.”’</p>

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3111">‘Dhritarashtra asked, “How was the battle between Karna and Bhima, both of whom were immensely strong? In the vicinity of Arjuna’s chariot, what was its nature? In the earlier encounter, Karna had been defeated by Bhimasena. How could maharatha Radheya progress against Bhima? In the battle, how did Bhima face the son of the suta, regarded as a maharatha and the foremost among all rathas on earth? Having surpassed Bhishma and Drona, Yudhishthira, Dharma’s son, did not fear anyone as much as he did the archer Karna. Thinking of the maharatha, he<a id="calibre_link-658" href="#calibre_link-221" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">314</sup></a> always lay down in fear. How did Bhima fight with the son of the suta in battle? He never retreated in a battle. He was full of valour and devoted to brahmanas. How did Bhima fight with Karna, foremost among warriors, in the battle? In the encounter near Arjuna’s chariot, how did the son of the suta and Vrikodara, fight with each other? Since the son of the suta had earlier been told about the fraternal relationship,<a id="calibre_link-659" href="#calibre_link-222" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">315</sup></a> he was compassionate. Remembering the word that he had given to Kunti, how did he fight with Bhima?<a id="calibre_link-660" href="#calibre_link-223" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">316</sup></a> Bhima must have remembered the earlier enmity caused by the suta’s son? In the battle, how did the brave one fight with Karna? My son, Duryodhana, was always assured that Karna, the son of the suta, would defeat the united Pandavas in a battle. In the battle, for my wicked son, he was the hope for victory. How did he fight with Bhimasena, the performer of terrible deeds? Using him as a refuge, my sons engendered the enmity with those maharathas. O son! How did Bhima fight with that son of a suta? Having remembered the many hardships that the son of the suta had caused, how did Bhima fight with the son of the suta? The valiant son of a suta conquered the entire world on a single chariot. How did Bhima fight with him? He was born <a id="calibre_link-3112" class="calibre2"></a>with earrings and armour. How did Bhima fight with that son of a suta in battle? Tell me in detail about the battle that raged between those two and which of the two was victorious. O Sanjaya! You are skilled in narrating.”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3113">‘Sanjaya said, “Abandoning Radheya, supreme among rathas, Bhimasena attempted to go where the brave Krishna and Dhananjaya were. O great king! As he was leaving, Radheya attacked him and showered down arrows tufted with feathers of herons on him, like a cloud raining on a mountain. The face of Adhiratha’s powerful son was as beautiful as a blooming lotus and he challenged the departing Bhima to do battle. Bhimasena could not tolerate Karna’s summons to do battle. He did a semicircle<a id="calibre_link-661" href="#calibre_link-224" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">317</sup></a> and began to fight with the son of the suta. Armoured for the duel, the supreme among all wielders of weapons sought to bring down a great shower of iron arrows that travelled straight. Wishing to kill Karna, he began to tire him out, thinking that this was a means for bringing the quarrel to an end. O venerable one! The angry and intolerant Pandava, scorcher of enemies, showered down many kinds of fierce arrows. His gait was like that of a mad elephant and he showered down those arrows. However, the suta’s greatly illustrious son used the maya of his own weapons to devour them. Karna, the great archer, was greatly honoured because of his knowledge and began to roam around in that battle like a preceptor. As Bhimasena angrily fought, Radheya seemed to smile and taunt the furious and intolerant Vrikodara. In the battle, Kounteya could not tolerate Karna’s smile, since all the brave ones were fighting and watching them in every direction. Having approached him, the powerful and angry Bhimasena pierced him between the breasts with vatsadanta arrows, like a giant elephant being goaded. He pierced the charioteer of the son of the suta with well-tufted and sharp arrows and then used seventy-three well-directed arrows to pierce his<a id="calibre_link-662" href="#calibre_link-225" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">318</sup></a> colourful armour. The brave one enveloped the brave Karna’s horses, which were as swift as the wind and were clad in golden harnesses, and pierced each of them <a id="calibre_link-3114" class="calibre2"></a>with five arrows. O king! Karna released a net of arrows towards Bhimasena’s chariot and in a short instant, made Pandava disappear, with his chariot, his standard and his charioteer. O great king! Karna completely covered them with arrows released from his bow. Then Karna used sixty-four arrows to firmly pierce his armour and angrily struck him in the sides with iron arrows that could penetrate the inner organs. But Vrikodara ignored the extremely forceful arrows released from Karna’s bow and without any fear, struck the son of the suta. O great king! The arrows released from Karna’s bow were like venomous serpents. Though Bhima bore them in that battle, he suffered from no pain. In that encounter, the powerful Bhimasena struck Karna with thirty-two sharp and broad-headed arrows that were extremely energetic. However, Karna paid no attention to them. The mighty-armed Bhimasena wished to kill Saindhava and he covered him<a id="calibre_link-663" href="#calibre_link-226" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">319</sup></a> with arrows. Radheya fought mildly with Bhima. However, remembering the earlier enmity, Bhima, the conqueror of enemies, fought with anger and quickly released a shower of arrows. O king! The arrows released by Bhimasena in that battle descended all over him, like warbling birds.<a id="calibre_link-664" href="#calibre_link-227" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">320</sup></a> O great king! The arrows released from Bhima’s bow were gold-tufted. They dashed towards Radheya, like a wolf towards small deer. O king! Karna was foremost among rathas and in that encounter, released showers of fierce arrows that shrouded all the directions. He was the ornament of any battle and his arrows were like the vajra. However, before they could reach him, Vrikodara sliced them down with many broad-headed arrows. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! In that battle, Vaikartana Karna again enveloped maharatha Bhimasena with a shower of arrows. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! In that battle, we saw Bhima covered with those arrows and his body looked like that of a porcupine, with its quills jutting out. Those arrows released from Karna’s bow were gold-tufted and sharpened on stone. In that encounter, the brave one bore them, like the sun withstanding its own rays. Bhimasena looked beautiful, with blood <a id="calibre_link-3115" class="calibre2"></a>flowing from all his limbs. He was as golden as a flowering <em class="calibre4">palasha</em> tree in a grove. O great king! Bhima could not tolerate Karna’s conduct in that encounter. The great archer dilated his eyes in rage and struck Karna with twenty-five iron arrows. Karna looked like a white mountain, with the foothills covered with poisonous snakes.<a id="calibre_link-665" href="#calibre_link-228" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">321</sup></a> In that great battle, Bhima again pierced the son of the suta, who was as valorous as an immortal, with sixty-eight arrows in his inner organs. The powerful and enraged Bhimasena quickly severed Karna’s bow and all his implements. He used swift arrows to slay the four horses and the charioteer. With iron arrows as radiant as the sun’s rays, he struck Karna in the chest. O venerable one! After having pierced Karna, all of them penetrated the earth. O king! It was as if the sun’s rays were penetrating the clouds. He<a id="calibre_link-666" href="#calibre_link-229" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">322</sup></a> was proud of his manliness. But his bow had been severed and he was afflicted with arrows. He was overcome by great despondency and went to another chariot.”’</p>

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3117">‘Dhritarashtra asked, “O Sanjaya! The hopes of my sons being victorious have always been vested in him. On seeing him retreat in the battle, what did Duryodhana say? O son! In that encounter, what did Karna do after that?”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3118">‘Sanjaya replied, “On seeing Bhimasena in that battle, blazing like a fire, Karna resorted to another chariot that had been properly prepared and again attacked Pandava, like an ocean agitated by the wind. O lord of the earth! On seeing that Adhiratha’s son was enraged, your sons thought that Bhimasena was like oblation being poured into the mouth of a fire. Radheya created a great sound with the twang of his bow and a fierce sound with the slapping of his palms. He advanced towards Bhimasena’s chariot. O king! O lord <a id="calibre_link-3119" class="calibre2"></a>of the earth! A great and extremely terrible sound arose again, in the conflict between the son of the suta and Bhima. The mighty-armed ones were wrathful and wished to kill each other. They glanced at each other and seemed to burn each other down with their eyes. The eyes of the maharathas were red with rage and they sighed. Both of them were scorchers of enemies and they attacked and mangled each other. They fought against each other like angry tigers, or swift hawks, or wrathful <em class="calibre4">sharabha</em>s.<a id="calibre_link-667" href="#calibre_link-230" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">323</sup></a></p>

The scorcher of enemies thought of the difficulties in Virata’s city. Their prosperous and bejewelled kingdom had been robbed by your sons. You and your sons have always caused them difficulties and tried to burn down the innocent Kunti and her sons. The evil-souled ones mistreated Krishna<a id="calibre_link-668" href="#calibre_link-231" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">324</sup></a> in the assembly hall. ‘Accept another husband, since your husbands no longer remain.

In your presence, these were the words the Kurus spoke then. Your sons wished to enjoy Krishna, as they would enjoy a servant maid. They were later banished, attired in black antelope skin. In your presence, in the assembly hall, Karna then spoke harsh words to them. Your son thought that the Parthas were no more than mere straws. They were in desperate straits and he, deluded of his senses, was insolent. The slayer of enemies<a id="calibre_link-670" href="#calibre_link-233" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">326</sup></a> thought about these and other miseries suffered since childhood. Vrikodara, with dharma in his soul, no longer cared about remaining alive. He stretched his giant and invincible bow, with a golden back. Ready to give up his life, the tiger among the Bharata lineage attacked Karna. Bhima released a net of arrows, sharpened on stone, towards Karna’s chariot and shrouded him and the rays of the sun. Adhiratha’s son laughed at this. He swiftly <a id="calibre_link-3121" class="calibre2"></a>used his own net of arrows, sharpened on stone, to counter these and pierce Bhimasena. Adhiratha’s son was a maharatha. He was mighty-armed, immensely forceful and greatly strong. He pierced Bhima with nine sharp arrows. It was as if an elephant had been goaded. Vrikodara countered those arrows and without any fear, attacked the son of the suta. On seeing that the bull among the Pandava lineage was descending on him, with great ferocity and force, Karna countered him in that battle, like an elephant against a maddened elephant. He blew on his conch shell, with a sound that was like that of a hundred drums beating. Like a turbulent ocean, he agitated the army.<a id="calibre_link-671" href="#calibre_link-234" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">327</sup></a> That army was full of chariots, elephants, horses and infantry. On beholding the extraordinary sight,<a id="calibre_link-672" href="#calibre_link-235" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">328</sup></a> Bhima attacked Karna and covered him with arrows.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3122">‘“In that battle, Karna covered Pandava, and the horses and the men, with arrows. His supreme horses possessed the complexion of swans and he mixed these up with the horses of his opponent, which had the complexion of bears and were as swift as the wind or thought. On seeing that the horses had been mixed up, great lamentations issued from your sons. As swift as the wind, those horses were mixed up and looked extremely beautiful. O great king! They looked like black and white clouds that were mingled in the sky. Karna and Vrikodara were angry and their eyes were coppery red in rage. On seeing this, the maharathas on your side trembled in fright. The terrain where those warriors fought became as terrible as Yama’s kingdom. O foremost among the Bharata lineage! It was dreadful to look at, like the capital of the king of the dead. The maharathas seemed to look at a painted assembly, where, in warding off each other, they could see neither destruction, nor victory. O king! O lord of the earth!

They were beautiful to see, like two clouds showering down rain. O lord! The scorchers of enemies released arrows decorated with gold and made the sky look radiant, as if with flaming meteors.

There were many that were falling and those that had fallen, devoid of their lives. O great king! There was a great destruction of men amongst your sons. O bull among the Bharata lineage!

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3127">‘Dhritarashtra said, “I think Bhimasena’s valour is extraordinary, since he fought with Karna, who is brave and dexterous, in that battle. In an encounter, Karna is capable of repulsing the gods, the yakshas, the asuras and men, even if they are united and armed with every kind of weapon. O son! O Sanjaya! Pandava is blazing in his prosperity. But how could he not be vanquished? Tell me that. How did the battle between them continue, in which, each of them wagered their lives? I think that either of them was capable of being victorious, or being defeated. O suta! Having obtained Karna in the battle, my son, Suyodhana, was confident of defeating the Parthas, with Govinda and the Satvatas. But having heard that Karna was repeatedly defeated in the battle by Bhimasena, terrible in his deeds, I have lost my senses. Because of the wicked policies of my son, I <a id="calibre_link-3128" class="calibre2"></a>think that the Kouravas have already been destroyed. O Sanjaya! Karna will not be able to defeat those great archers, the Parthas. Whenever Karna has fought with the sons of Pandu, the Pandavas have always defeated him in the field of battle. O son! The Pandavas are incapable of being vanquished, even by the gods, with Vasava. My wicked son, Duryodhana, does not comprehend this. Partha<a id="calibre_link-674" href="#calibre_link-237" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">330</sup></a> is like the lord of riches.

I have been overcome by affection for my son and have maltreated the sons of Pandu, who are great-souled and have been established in dharma. Partha Yudhishthira is far-sighted and has always desired peace. But my sons thought that he was incapable and maltreated him. The mighty-armed Bhima bears all the assorted hardships and diverse ill-treatment in his heart and has fought with the son of the suta. O Sanjaya! Karna and Bhima are foremost among warriors and wished to kill each other. In that battle, tell me how they fought.”</p>

O foremost among the Bharata lineage! Bhima was struck by Vaikartana’s arrows. However, while he was attacking, Bhima used three sharp arrows to sever his bow and used a broad-headed arrow to bring his charioteer down from the seat of the chariot onto the ground. Vaikartana Vrisha<a id="calibre_link-677" href="#calibre_link-240" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">333</sup></a> wished to kill Bhimasena. He grasped a giant javelin, which was like a javelin <a id="calibre_link-3130" class="calibre2"></a>used by Death. The shaft and handle of that javelin was colourfully decorated with gold and lapis lazuli. The immensely strong Radheya hurled it at Bhimasena and it was capable of robbing him of his life. Having released the javelin, like Purandara with his vajra, the powerful son of the suta emitted an extremely loud roar. On hearing that roar, your sons were delighted. That javelin was released from Karna’s hands and was as radiant as the sun or the fire. However, while it was still traversing, Bhima severed it with seven arrows. O venerable one! Thus severed by Bhima as it was travelling through the air, the javelin looked like a snake that has cast off its skin. Wishing to rob the son of the suta of his life, he then angrily released many arrows shafted with the feathers of peacocks. They were gold-tufted and sharpened on stone and in that battle, each of them was like Yama’s staff. Karna took up another bow that possessed a golden back and was unassailable. The immensely energetic one drew it and shot many arrows. However, Pandu’s son severed these with nine arrows with drooping tufts. O king! Having severed those great arrows shot by Vasushena,<a id="calibre_link-678" href="#calibre_link-241" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">334</sup></a> Bhima roared like a lion. O great king!

They drew their bows back to the full extent and struck each other with arrows. O great king! They scorched each other with showers of arrows. They glanced towards each other, with eyes dilated with rage. They laughed at each other and repeatedly censured each other. As they fought with each other, they blew on their conch shells.

Karna powerfully struck Bhima with a storm of arrows. He roared loudly and again struck him on the chest. Bhima pierced him back with ten arrows and again struck him with twenty arrows with drooping tufts. O king!

Released from the bow of the suta’s son, it pierced Partha in that battle and penetrated the earth. The mighty-armed Bhima grasped a heavy club that was completely made out of iron.

Durmukha’s inner organs were shattered and he lay down, blood flowing from his wounds. On seeing this, Karna’s eyes were full of tears and he paused for a while. The brave Karna circumambulated the one who had lost his life and left him there. His sighs were deep and warm and he did not know what to do. O king! Using that gap, Bhimasena shot fourteen iron arrows that were shafted with the feathers of vultures at the son of the suta. These were colourful, gold-tufted and extremely energetic and were the drinkers of blood. O great king! These illuminated the ten directions and penetrated his armour, drinking the blood of the son of the suta. O Indra among kings! Those arrows were like angry serpents, urged by destiny, as they penetrated the earth, after having passed through his body. They were like large and angry serpents, half-inserted into their holes.<a id="calibre_link-687" href="#calibre_link-250" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">343</sup></a> Without any reflection, Radheya pierced him back with fourteen extremely sharp and iron arrows that were decorated with gold. Those arrows penetrated Bhimasena’s left arm and penetrated the earth, like fierce curlews entering a tree. On having penetrated the ground, those iron arrows were resplendent. They were like the blazing rays of the sun, as it heads towards setting. In that battle, Bhima was mangled by those iron arrows that penetrated the inner organs. He shed a great deal of blood, like water flowing out of a mountain. In turn, Bhima pierced the son of the suta with three arrows and used another seven arrows, with the force of Suparna,<a id="calibre_link-688" href="#calibre_link-251" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">344</sup></a> to pierce his charioteer. O great king! Afflicted by Bhima’s strength, Karna was agitated. The immensely illustrious one gave up the battle and fled on his swift horses. Bhimasena stretched his bow, embellished in gold. In that battle, the atiratha was stationed like a blazing fire.”’</p>

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3140">‘Dhritarashtra said, “I think that destiny is supreme. Since Adhiratha’s son strove and could not overcome Pandava in the battle, shame on manliness. Karna is capable of vanquishing the Parthas, with Govinda, in an encounter. The world has never seen a warrior who is Karna’s equal. I have repeatedly heard Duryodhana speak in this vein. ‘Karna is powerful and brave. He wields a firm bow and has conquered exhaustion. O king!<a id="calibre_link-689" href="#calibre_link-252" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">345</sup></a> If I have Vasushena as my aide, even the gods will not be able to withstand me in battle, not to speak of the sons of Pandu, who have lost their spirits and their endeavour.’ On seeing this Karna defeated in the battle, like a snake that has lost its poison and has run away, what did Duryodhana say? Alas! Durmukha was not skilled in fighting. But he<a id="calibre_link-690" href="#calibre_link-253" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">346</sup></a> sent him alone and he entered the fierce battle, like a deluded insect. O Sanjaya! There is no doubt that Ashvatthama, the king of Madra and Kripa, united with Karna, cannot stand before Bhima. He is extremely terrible and possesses the strength of ten thousand elephants. They know this and the cruelty and energy of Maruta’s<a id="calibre_link-691" href="#calibre_link-254" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">347</sup></a> son. Why did they anger the performer of cruel deeds, who is proud of his strength and valour and is like Yama at the end of a yuga, in the battle? It seems that Karna, the mighty-armed son of the suta, has depended on the strength of his arms alone and disregarding this,<a id="calibre_link-692" href="#calibre_link-255" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">348</sup></a> has chosen to fight with Bhimasena in the battle. Pandu’s son defeated Karna in the encounter, like Purandara against the asuras. Who is capable of vanquishing him in a fight? In his search for Dhananjaya, he shattered Drona and penetrated my army. Who is capable of approaching Bhima and remaining alive? O Sanjaya! He is like the great Indra, with the thunderous vajra raised against the danavas. Who has the enterprise to station himself in front of Bhima? Having reached the capital <a id="calibre_link-3141" class="calibre2"></a>of the king of the dead, a man may return. But having approached Bhimasena, no one can ever return. Those with limited intelligence will enter and advance against the wrathful Bhimasena, like insects advancing towards a flame, bereft of their senses. In the assembly hall and in the hearing of the Kurus, Bhima took a pledge about killing my sons. Having seen Karna defeated, Duhshasana and his brothers must be thinking about that and, out of fear, must have retreated from attacking Bhima. O Sanjaya! That evil-minded son<a id="calibre_link-693" href="#calibre_link-256" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">349</sup></a> of mine repeatedly said in the assembly, ‘In the battle, Karna, Duhshasana and I will conquer the Pandavas.’ O Sanjaya! On seeing Karna deprived of his chariot and defeated by Bhima, there is no doubt that he must be severely repenting his refusal of Krishna.<a id="calibre_link-694" href="#calibre_link-257" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">350</sup></a> On seeing his armoured brothers killed in the battle by Bhimasena, there is no doubt that my son is greatly tormented by his own crimes. No one who wishes to live will advance against Pandava Bhima. His weapons are terrible and he is enraged. He is stationed like Death himself. A man can escape from the mouth and midst of the <em class="calibre4">vadava</em> fire.<a id="calibre_link-695" href="#calibre_link-258" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">351</sup></a> But it is my view that no one can escape, having approached Bhima’s mouth. When they are enraged in battle, the Pandavas, the Panchalas, Keshava and Satyaki, do not know how to protect their own lives.”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3142">‘Sanjaya replied, “O Kourava! You are sorrowing because of the destruction of men that is occurring. But there is no doubt that you are the root behind this destruction of the earth. Devoted to the words of your sons, you are yourself the cause of this great enmity. Though you were urged, like a dying man, you did not accept the diet and the medicines. O great king! You have yourself drunk <em class="calibre4">kalakuta</em>, which is impossible to digest.<a id="calibre_link-696" href="#calibre_link-259" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">352</sup></a> O supreme among men! You are now suffering the fruits of that action. The warriors on your side are fighting to the utmost of their strength, but you are censuring them. Let me describe to you the raging battle.</p>

<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3144">‘“O venerable one! On seeing that Karna had been defeated by Bhimasena, five brothers who are your sons, Durmarshana, Duhsaha, Durmada, Durdhara and Jaya, could not tolerate this. Clad in colourful armour, they advanced against Pandava. They surrounded the mighty-armed Vrikodara from all directions and covered him with arrows that were like flying locusts. On seeing those princes, who were like the gods in their beauty, suddenly advance against him in that battle, Bhimasena smiled and received them. On seeing your sons approach Bhimasena, Radheya attacked the immensely strong Bhimasena. O king! He showered arrows that were gold-tufted and sharpened on stone. However, Bhima attacked quickly and repulsed your sons. The Kurus surrounded Karna from all directions and countered Bhimasena with arrows with straight tufts. O king! But Bhima used his terrible bow to shoot twenty-five arrows and dispatched those bulls among men,<a id="calibre_link-697" href="#calibre_link-260" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">353</sup></a> with their charioteers, to Yama’s eternal abode. With their charioteers, they lost their lives and fell down from their chariots. They were like giant trees with colourful blossoms, uprooted by a storm. We witnessed Bhimasena’s extraordinary valour. He countered Adhiratha’s son and killed your sons with his arrows. O great king! In every direction, the son of the suta was checked by Bhima’s sharp arrows and he could only look at Bhimasena. Bhimasena was angry and his eyes were red with rage. He repeatedly stretched his giant bow and glanced at Karna.”’</p>

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3146">‘Sanjaya said, “On seeing that your sons had fallen down, the powerful Karna was overcome by great rage and lost all hope of remaining alive. Adhiratha’s son censured himself.<a id="calibre_link-698" href="#calibre_link-261" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">354</sup></a> Without any fear, he angrily attacked Bhimasena. Radheya smiled and pierced Bhima with five arrows. He again pierced him with seventy arrows <a id="calibre_link-3147" class="calibre2"></a>that were gold-tufted and sharpened on stone. Partha Vrikodara laughed at them and intolerantly, pierced Radheya with a hundred arrows with drooping tufts. He again pierced him with five sharp and swift arrows. O venerable one! With a broad-headed arrow, he severed the bow of the son of the suta. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! Karna was distressed and took up another bow. In every direction, he enveloped Bhimasena with arrows. However, Bhima smiled and killed his horses and his charioteer. Having done this, he laughed out loudly. O great king! The bull among men severed his bow,<a id="calibre_link-699" href="#calibre_link-262" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">355</sup></a> with a golden back, with arrows and it fell down with a loud noise. At this, maharatha Karna descended from his chariot. In that battle, he grasped a club and hurled it at Bhimasena. O king! On seeing that club suddenly descend, Vrikodara countered it with his arrows, while all your soldiers looked on. Wishing to kill the son of the suta, the brave and spirited Pandava shot a thousand arrows at him. In that great battle, Karna countered these arrows with arrows of his own and with his arrows, brought down Bhimasena’s armour. While all the beings looked on, he then struck him with twenty-five kshudraka arrows and it was extraordinary. O great king! O venerable one! Bhima became angry. In that battle, he dispatched nine sharp arrows with drooping tufts towards the son of the suta. They pierced his armour and his right arm and penetrated the ground, like snakes entering a termite hill. In that encounter, on seeing that Radheya was on foot and was agitated by Bhimasena, King Duryodhana said, ‘All of you hasten towards Radheya’s chariot.’ O king! On hearing the words of their brother, your sons advanced against Pandava in the battle and shot sharp arrows. They were Chitra, Upachitra, Chitraksha, Charuchitra, Sharasana, Chitrayudha, Chitravarma and Chitrayodhina. O king! In that battle, these maharathas suddenly advanced against Bhima. In that encounter, he killed them and their horses, charioteers, standards and brought them down on the ground, like trees uprooted by a storm. O king! On beholding that your maharatha sons had been killed, Karna’s eyes were filled with tears and his face was full of dejection. He again <a id="calibre_link-3148" class="calibre2"></a>mounted a chariot that had been properly prepared. In that encounter, the brave one spiritedly attacked Pandava. They pierced each other with gold-tufted arrows that were sharpened on stone. O great king! They looked as beautiful as blossoming kimshukas. Pandava angrily struck the armour of the son of the suta with thirty six sharp and broad-headed arrows that were fierce in their energy. They had deep wounds on their bodies, caused by the arrows, and they smeared red sandalwood paste on these. They were covered with blood and were as resplendent as the sun that arises at the time of destruction. Blood flowed from the wounds on their bodies. Their armour was shattered by arrows. Bereft of armour, they were as beautiful as snakes that had cast off their skins. Like tigers attacking each other with their teeth, those tigers among men mangled each other with arrows that were like teeth. Those scorchers of enemies were resplendent in that arena, like clashing elephants. They were like crazy elephants in their valour and persecuted each other with sharp arrows. In that battle, they enveloped each other with nets of arrows. O great king! As they roamed around, their chariots roared in all the directions. Those chariots executed circular motions. Those great-souled ones roamed around like Vritra and the wielder of the vajra. As he stretched his bow with his arms, with arm-guards on them, Bhima roamed around in that battle like a cloud tinged with lightning. The twang of his bow was like thunder and there was a shower of arrows from that great cloud. O great king! The cloud that was Bhima rained down on the mountain that was Karna. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! Pandava shot a thousand arrows from his bow and shrouded Karna with that dense shower, like rain on a mountain. Your sons witnessed Bhimasena’s valour there. He enveloped Karna with arrows that were well-tufted with the feathers of herons. As Bhima fought with Karna in that battle, he delighted Partha,<a id="calibre_link-700" href="#calibre_link-263" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">356</sup></a> the illustrious Keshava, Satyaki and the two who guarded the chariot wheels.<a id="calibre_link-701" href="#calibre_link-264" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">357</sup></a> O great king! Pandava knew about his own valour, strength of arms and fortitude. But your sons witnessed it.”’</p>

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3151">‘Sanjaya said, “On hearing the slap of Bhimasena’s bowstring against his palms, Radheya could not tolerate it and advanced like a mad elephant against another elephant. He had moved away from the reach of Bhima’s arrows for only an instant. Adhiratha’s son saw that your sons had been brought down from their chariots and had been killed by Bhimasena. He was distressed and miserable. He sighed long and warm sighs and again attacked Pandava. His eyes were coppery red in anger and he sighed like a giant serpent. As he released his arrows, Karna was as resplendent as the sun with its rays. O bull among the Bharata lineage! Vrikodara was shrouded by the arrows released from Karna’s bow, which were like the rays of the sun. The colourful arrows released from Karna’s bow were tufted with the feathers of peacocks. They penetrated all over Partha, like birds entering a tree. The arrows released from Karna’s bow descended incessantly. They were gold-tufted and looked like a continuous array of swans. O king! Such was the power of the arrows shot by Adhiratha’s son that it seemed as if they were issuing not only from the bow, but also the standard, the seat, the umbrella, the yoke and the floor.<a id="calibre_link-702" href="#calibre_link-265" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">358</sup></a> The arrows released by Adhiratha’s son filled the sky with their great force and were tufted with the feathers of birds. They were colourful and decorated with gold. Vrikodara saw that they were descending towards him, like Death. He became ready to give up his life and angrily pierced him<a id="calibre_link-703" href="#calibre_link-266" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">359</sup></a> with nine arrows. The brave Pandava saw the great force of Karna’s storm of arrows, but did not waver. Pandava shot a net of arrows towards Adhiratha’s son and again pierced Karna with another twenty sharp arrows. In that encounter, just as Partha enveloped the son of the suta with arrows, Karna also shrouded Pandava. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! On witnessing Bhimasena’s valour in that fight, those on your side were delighted and praised him, as did the charanas. Ten of the foremost of rathas among the Kurus and the Pandavas&mdash;Bhurishrava, <a id="calibre_link-3152" class="calibre2"></a>Kripa, Drona’s son, the king of Madra, Jayadratha, Uttamouja, Yudhamanyu, Satyaki, Keshava and Arjuna&mdash;uttered words of praise and roared loudly, like lions. There was a tumultuous sound and it made the body hair stand up.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3153">‘“O king! Your son, Duryodhana, quickly spoke to the kings and the princes, and especially to his brothers. ‘O fortunate ones! Advance towards Karna and save him from Vrikodara. Ahead of us, the arrows released by Bhima are striking Radheya. All of you great archers should make efforts to protect the son of the suta.’ O venerable one! Having been instructed by Duryodhana, seven of his brothers angrily attacked Bhimasena and surrounded him from all sides. They approached Kounteya and covered him with showers of arrows. This was like the slayer of Bala showering down rain on a mountain. O king! Bhimasena was oppressed by those seven angry maharathas, like seven planets afflicting the moon at the time of destruction. O king! Pandava Kounteya drew the well-decorated and firm bow with his left hand and held it in his hand.<a id="calibre_link-704" href="#calibre_link-267" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">360</sup></a> Knowing that they were only men,<a id="calibre_link-705" href="#calibre_link-268" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">361</sup></a> the lord affixed and released seven arrows that were as bright as the rays of the sun. O great king! Bhimasena remembered the earlier enmity and took away the lives from the bodies of your sons. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! Bhimasena shot arrows at those descendants of the Bharata lineage. These were gold-tufted and sharpened on stone and coursed through the sky. Those arrows were decorated with gold and pierced through their hearts. O great king! They were as resplendent as Suparna<a id="calibre_link-706" href="#calibre_link-269" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">362</sup></a> travelling through the sky. O Indra among kings! They were fierce and decorated with gold and now had blood on their tips. They drank the blood of your sons. Those arrows penetrated their inner organs and brought them down from the chariots onto the ground. They were like giant trees on mountain tops, shattered by an elephant. Shatrunjaya, Shatrusaha, Chitra, Chitrayudha, Dridha, Chitrasena and Vikarna&mdash;these seven were brought down.</p>

On hearing the great roar emitted by the archer Bhimasena in the battle, Dharmaraja was supremely delighted. O great king! In joy, musical instruments were played in loud tones. Having heard Bhimasena’s roar, Partha<a id="calibre_link-707" href="#calibre_link-270" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">363</sup></a> attacked Drona, supreme among the wielders of weapons, from every direction. On receiving the sign from Vrikodara, he was filled with great delight. O great king! On seeing that thirty-one of your maharatha sons had been killed, Duryodhana remembered the words of Kshatta,<a id="calibre_link-708" href="#calibre_link-271" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">364</sup></a> which had been spoken at the time of the gambling match to your evil-minded son, when Karna had spoken harsh words to Krishna<a id="calibre_link-709" href="#calibre_link-272" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">365</sup></a> in the assembly hall. O lord of the earth! This was in your presence and in that of the sons of Pandu and in the presence of all the Kouravas and the preceptor. ‘O Krishna!<a id="calibre_link-710" href="#calibre_link-273" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">366</sup></a> The Pandavas have been destroyed and have gone to eternal hell. Accept someone else as a husband.’ Those harsh words spoken to Droupadi in the assembly hall are now bearing fruit. Thinking of this, the king<a id="calibre_link-711" href="#calibre_link-274" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">367</sup></a> did not know what to do next. The Pandavas wield fierce bows and will kill your sons in their anger. O Kourava! The fire of Bhimasena’s anger has been restrained for thirteen years. It is now being released and will convey your sons towards destruction. Having lamented a lot, Kshatta failed to obtain peace from you. O foremost among the Bharata lineage! With your sons, enjoy the fruits of that now. O Indra among kings! Vikarna and the valiant Chitrasena, foremost among your sons, have been killed and so have other maharatha sons, all those who have come within the range of Bhima’s sight. O mighty-armed one! He swiftly slew your sons. It is only because of your deeds that I saw our arrays <a id="calibre_link-3156" class="calibre2"></a>being scorched, as a result of the thousands of arrows released by Pandava and Vrisha.”’<a id="calibre_link-712" href="#calibre_link-275" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">368</sup></a></p>

In that great battle, they showered down arrows, like rain pouring down from clouds. There were gold-tufted arrows that were sharpened on stone and marked with Bhima’s name. These pierced Karna, as if penetrating his life. In that fashion, Bhima was struck in that battle by hundreds and thousands of arrows released by Karna and these were like venomous serpents. O great king! Those arrows descended in every direction and agitated the armies, which were like oceans. O scorcher of enemies! The arrows released from Bhima’s bow were as terrible as virulent serpents and killed your soldiers in the midst of the army. O king! Elephants fell down and mixed with horses and men. They were seen to be strewn around on the ground, like trees shattered by a storm. In that battle, they were slain by the arrows released from Bhima’s bow. Your warriors were driven away, exclaiming, ‘What is this?’ The great force of arrows released by Karna and Pandava made the soldiers from Sindhus, Souviras and Kouravas move a great distance away. Many horses, men and mounts were afflicted and slain by the arrows. They abandoned Karna and Bhima and fled in all the directions, saying, <a id="calibre_link-3160" class="calibre2"></a>‘There is no doubt that, for the sake of the Parthas, the residents of heaven are confounding us, since the force of Karna and Bhima’s arrows are killing our troops.’ Having said this, the warriors on your side were afflicted by fear. They moved away from the range of the arrows and stationed themselves, wishing to see the encounter. In that great battle, a river, terrible in form, began to flow. It was beautiful and in particular, increased the fear of cowards. This was created from the blood of elephants, horses and men. It covered the bodies of men, elephants and horses, who had lost their lives. Housings, flags, elephants, horses and chariots were like ornaments. There were shattered chariots and fragmented wheels, axles and yokes. There were extremely expensive bows that were decorated with gold. There were gold-tufted arrows and thousands of iron arrows. These were released by Karna and Pandava and were like snakes that had cast off their skins. There were masses of lances, spears, swords, battleaxes, clubs, maces, spikes, vajras of different types, javelins, bludgeons and shataghnis. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! They were decorated with gold and made the ground beautiful. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! There were golden bracelets, armlets, sparkling and bejewelled earrings, body armour, palm-guards and golden necklaces. There were garments and umbrellas and shattered whisks and fans. There were elephants, horses and men who were mangled by weapons and ornaments from chariots. Shattered and broken, they were strewn around here and there on the ground, making it as beautiful as the sky with the planets. These superhuman deeds were extraordinary and could not be thought of. On beholding these, the charanas and the siddhas were overcome by wonder. A fire, when aided by the wind, burns down dry grass. Like that, aided by Bhima and engaging with him, Adhiratha’s son fiercely brought down standards and chariots and slew horses, elephants and men. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! As they engaged with each other in that battle, they were like a couple of elephants amidst a clump of reeds. As they clashed in that supreme battle, Karna and Bhima, caused carnage in that great army.”’</p>

In that battle, Bhimasena pierced Karna with a sharp, yellow and barbed arrow. O great king! He brought down Karna’s great and golden earring on the ground, as if a flaming stellar body had been dislodged from the sky. The immensely strong Bhima seemed to be smiling. With another broad-headed arrow, he grievously struck the son of the suta between the breasts. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! In that battle, Bhima again dispatched ten iron arrows. These were extremely forceful and were like Yama’s staff. O venerable one! They struck the son of the suta on his forehead and thus released, penetrated like snakes entering a termite hill. With those arrows on his forehead, the son of the suta looked dazzling, as he had done earlier, when he had donned a garland of blue lotuses.<a id="calibre_link-713" href="#calibre_link-276" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">369</sup></a> In that battle, Karna, the wielder of a firm bow, was afflicted and enraged.

He ignored them and released a fierce shower of arrows. O great king! Karna, the scorcher of enemies, adopted a fierce form and angrily struck Pandava in the chest with sharp arrows. In that encounter, they showered down on each other, like clouds. They terrified each other with the slapping of their palms. In that encounter, they enveloped each other with diverse nets of arrows. In that battle, they wrathfully acted so as to counteract the other. The mighty-armed and great-souled Bhima severed Karna’s bow with a kshurapra arrow and pierced him with arrows.</p>

In every direction, he saw bodies of elephants, horses and men that had lost their lives. A great and blazing anger was generated in his body. He stretched his great bow, which was decorated with gold. O king! Radheya glanced at Bhima with fierce eyes.

Karna shot arrows to the right and to the left and his bow was like a terrible circle of fire. The arrows released from Karna’s bow were extremely sharp and gold-tufted. O great king!

The arrows released from the bow of Adhiratha’s son were as beautiful as an array of cranes in the sky. They were tufted with the feathers of vultures. They were sharpened on stone. They were decorated with gold and were extremely forceful. Those arrows released by Adhiratha’s son flamed at the tip. They were decorated with gold and were released by the force of the bow. Many such arrows descended towards Partha’s chariot. There were thousands of them in the sky, decorated with jewels. Those arrows shot by Karna were like a storm of locusts. As those arrows were continuously released from the bow of Adhiratha’s son, they seemed to form a single long arrow in the sky. Like a cloud pouring down torrents of rain on a mountain, Karna angrily enveloped Bhima with a shower of arrows.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3166">‘“O descendant of the Bharata lineage! Your sons, together with the Kurus, then witnessed Bhima’s strength, valour and prowess. <a id="calibre_link-3167" class="calibre2"></a>That shower of arrows created by Karna was like an ocean. But he disregarded it and angrily attacked him. O lord of the earth! Bhima had a large bow with a golden back. He stretched it in a circle and it looked like Shakra’s bow. The arrows released from it covered up the sky. Bhima’s arrows were gold-tufted, with drooping tufts. They were as beautiful as a golden garland that has been created in the sky. That net of arrows that was spread out in the sky<a id="calibre_link-715" href="#calibre_link-278" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">371</sup></a> was struck and shattered by Bhimasena’s arrows. In that battle, both Karna and Bhimasena created nets of straight-flying arrows that clashed against each other and produced sparks of fire. These were gold-tufted and covered the sky, as they traversed through it. Disregarding the valour of the great-minded one, the son of the suta used other arrows to envelope Bhima. O venerable one! Those nets of arrows created there seemed to be like two storms of wind clashing against each other. Wishing to kill him, Karna used sharp arrows that had been crafted by artisans and were decorated with gold and angrily shot these. But asking the son of the suta to wait, Bhima used his own arrows to sever each of these into three fragments in the sky. Once again, Pandava showered down fierce arrows. He was intolerant, powerful and angry. He was like a fire that destroys everything. However, Karna showed no fear and received all these weapons with his own. As he fought with Pandu’s son, the son of the suta used the maya of his weapons and severed his quivers and his bowstring with arrows that had drooping tufts. Vaikartana Karna then severed the harnesses of the horses. He killed his horses and pierced his charioteer with three arrows. Descending, the charioteer swiftly fled towards Yuyudhana’s chariot. Radheya was angry and his radiance was like the fire at the time of destruction. He smiled and severed Bhima’s standard and brought down his flag.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3168">‘“O great king! Without a bow, he grasped a spear and angrily hurled it towards Karna’s chariot.<a id="calibre_link-716" href="#calibre_link-279" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">372</sup></a> As that spear, embellished with gold and like a giant meteor, descended towards him, Adhiratha’s <a id="calibre_link-3169" class="calibre2"></a>son severed it with ten arrows. O king! Having been shattered into ten fragments by Karna’s arrows, it fell down. The son of the suta was wonderful in fighting and was acting for the sake of his friends. Kounteya then grasped a shield that was embellished with gold and a sword, wishing for either death or victory, and advanced suddenly. O great king! But Karna smiled and severed the shield. He was without a chariot and was senseless with anger. He hurled the sword towards Karna’s chariot. The extremely sharp sword severed the bow and the bowstring of the son of the suta and then fell down on the ground, like a snake that has fallen from the sky. Adhiratha’s son laughed and wrathfully took up another bow that was capable of killing enemies in battle and was more firm and more powerful. The angry Bhimasena was powerful and truth was his valour. He distressed Karna by leaping up into the sky. On witnessing the conduct on the part of the one who wished to be victorious in the battle, Radheya deceived Bhimasena by hiding. His senses were benumbed and he hid on the floor of his chariot. On seeing this, he grasped his flagpole and remained stationed on the ground.<a id="calibre_link-717" href="#calibre_link-280" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">373</sup></a> All the Kurus and the charanas applauded this attempt of snatching Karna from his chariot, like Tarkshya<a id="calibre_link-718" href="#calibre_link-281" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">374</sup></a> grabbing a serpent. His bow was severed and he was without a chariot. But he was devoted to following his own dharma. Turning his back towards his own chariot, he remained stationed on the field of battle.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3170">‘“Wishing to kill him, Radheya again angrily attacked Pandava, who was waiting to fight in the battle. Those two immensely strong ones encountered each other and challenged each other in that great arena. They roared like clouds in the sky at the end of summer. Those two lions among men were excited and enraged. They were intolerant towards each other in the battle, like the gods and the danavas. Though his weapons were exhausted, Kounteya was attacked by Karna. He saw the elephants that had been slain by Arjuna and they were as large as a mountain. To create an obstruction in the path of the chariot,<a id="calibre_link-719" href="#calibre_link-282" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">375</sup></a> he entered into their midst. He entered those <a id="calibre_link-3171" class="calibre2"></a>elephants, which were difficult for a chariot to penetrate. Wishing to save his own life, Pandava did not strike Radheya. Instead, Partha, the destroyer of enemy cities, raised an elephant that had been killed by Dhananjaya’s arrows and remained stationed there. However, Karna used his arrows to strike down that elephant. Pandava roared and hurled the limbs of the elephant towards Karna. He also hurled wheels, horses, mounts and anything else that he could see on the ground. Pandava grabbed these and angrily hurled them towards Karna. Karna used sharp arrows to sever everything that was repeatedly hurled at him. However, remembering Kunti’s words, he did not kill him.<a id="calibre_link-720" href="#calibre_link-283" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">376</sup></a> Instead, Karna approached him and touched him with the tip of his bow.</p>

You have no skill in weapons, but wish to fight with me. You are only a child and become distressed in battle. O Pandava! You should be where there are many kinds of food and things to eat and drink. O evil-minded one! You should be there and should never fight. O Bhima! O extremely evil-minded one! You should become a hermit and live on fruit. O Kounteya! Go to the forest. You have no skills in fighting. You should subsist on fruits and roots and in tending to guests. O Vrikodara! I do not think that you are fit to raise weapons. You should collect flowers and live on roots and fruits and attend to vows and rites. O Bhima! You should be in the forest. You are not skilled in fighting. O son! You should not be in a battle. You should be exiled to the forest. O Vrikodara! In a household, you can only urge cooks, servants, men and slaves to hasten in their tasks and are capable of reproaching them for the sake of food.’ O lord of the earth! In harsh words, he also reminded him about all the unpleasant things that were earlier done to him during his childhood. As he weakly stood there, he again touched him with his bow and laughed. Vrisha again spoke these words to Bhima. ‘Fight with others. Do not fight with the likes of <a id="calibre_link-3173" class="calibre2"></a>me. Those who fight with the likes of me have to face this and many other things. Go where the two Krishnas are and they will protect you in this battle. O Kounteya! Otherwise, go home. O child! Why do you wish to fight?’ O king! Having deprived him of his chariot, Karna spoke these words to him, in the presence of the lion among the Vrishni lineage and the great-minded Partha.<a id="calibre_link-721" href="#calibre_link-284" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">377</sup></a></p>

Those arrows released by Partha were embellished with gold. They were shot from the force of Gandiva and penetrated Karna, like swans into Mount Krouncha. Those arrows released from Gandiva penetrated like snakes. Dhananjaya drove the son of the suta away from Bhimasena. His bow had been severed by Bhima and he was afflicted by Dhananjaya’s arrows. Karna mounted his giant chariot and quickly fled from Bhima. Bhima, bull among men, mounted Satyaki’s chariot and followed his brother, Pandava Savyasachi, in that battle. His eyes coppery red in anger, Dhananjaya swiftly dispatched an iron arrow towards Karna and it was like Destroyer urging Death. That iron arrow, released from Gandiva, swiftly sped towards Karna, like Garuda descending from the sky in search of a supreme serpent. Using his own arrow, Drona’s son severed the iron arrow in the air. The maharatha wished to free Karna from his fear of Dhananjaya. O great king! Arjuna angrily pierced Drona’s son with sixty-four arrows that were sharpened on stone. He asked him to wait and not run away. However, Drona’s son was afflicted by Dhananjaya’s arrows. He quickly penetrated an array that was full of crazy elephants and chariots. In the battle, the powerful Kounteya used the roar of Gandiva to drown the noises of all the other gold-backed bows. Dhananjaya followed Drona’s son, who had only gone a short distance away, and terrified him with the strength of his arrows. He mangled the bodies of men, elephants and horses with his iron arrows, which were tufted with the feathers of herons and peacocks. Arjuna crushed that army. O best of the <a id="calibre_link-3175" class="calibre2"></a>Bharata lineage! Partha, the son of the chastiser of Paka, slaughtered that force, with its horses, elephants and men.”’</p>

Many of my warriors have been killed and I think that this is because of destiny. The enraged Dhananjaya has penetrated into my army. It is protected by Drona and Karna and is incapable of being penetrated by the gods. Krishna and Bhima, the two with blazing energy, are with him and have increased his valour. There is also the bull among the Shini lineage. Ever since I have heard about his entry, my sorrow is consuming me, like a fire on dry grass. I can see all the lords of the earth, with Saindhava, being devoured. The king of Sindhu has done an extremely great injury to Kiriti and if he comes within his sight, how can he escape with his life? O Sanjaya! From the signs, I do not see Saindhava remaining alive. But I am asking you to tell me about how the battle raged. How did the angry one penetrate my large army single-handed and agitate and trouble it, like an elephant amidst lotuses? Tell me exactly about the battle that the brave one from the Vrishni lineage fought, for Dhananjaya’s sake. O Sanjaya! You are skilled in narration.”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3178">‘Sanjaya replied, “O king! On seeing that Bhima, foremost among men, was oppressed by Vaikartana in the midst of those brave men, the foremost of the Shini lineage followed him on his chariot. He roared, like the wielder of the vajra at the end of summer. He blazed, like the sun at the end of the monsoon. With his firm bow, he killed the enemies and made the army of your son tremble. The brave one among men fought and roamed around, drawn on mounts that were silvery in complexion. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! No one among the rathas on your side was capable of countering the fierce Madhava. Alambusa, foremost among kings, <a id="calibre_link-3179" class="calibre2"></a>became intolerant.<a id="calibre_link-722" href="#calibre_link-285" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">378</sup></a> He was clad in golden armour, wielded a bow and arrow and never retreated from the field of battle. He attacked Satyaki, foremost among the Madhava lineage. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! The likes of the encounter between them has never been seen before. All the warriors, on your side and that of the enemy, became spectators in that clash between those two ornaments of battle. Alambusa, supreme among kings, shot ten arrows at him. However, the bull among the Shini lineage, struck those arrows down with his own arrows, before they could reach him. He<a id="calibre_link-723" href="#calibre_link-286" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">379</sup></a> drew his bow back up to his ears and again struck him with three well-tufted and sharp arrows that were like the fire. These shattered Satyaki’s armour and penetrated his body. Having pierced his body with those arrows that had the force of the fire and the wind, he again struck his four horses, with the complexion of silver, with four other arrows. Shini’s grandson was as spirited and powerful as the wielder of the chakra himself.<a id="calibre_link-724" href="#calibre_link-287" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">380</sup></a> Though he was struck, he used four forceful arrows to kill Alambusa’s four horses.

It was severed from the body. O king! Having killed that son and grandson of a king in that battle, the brave bull among the Madhu lineage tormented and countered your soldiers and went towards Arjuna. The supreme among the Vrishni lineage was seen to circle around in the midst of the enemy. As he proceeded, he repeatedly slaughtered the Kuru forces with his arrows, like the wind dispelling a mass of clouds. He was borne on well-trained and controlled horses from the Sindhu region. They were as white as cow’s milk, the kunda flower, the moon or snow. They were well-trained horses and had harnesses that were golden in complexion. They bore the lion among men wherever he desired.</p>

The brave one, supreme among the Satvata lineage, countered them with his net of arrows. Shini’s grandson, the slayer of enemies, used arrows that were like the fire and quickly countered them.

The great archers from Trigarta, their standards decorated with gold, surrounded him from all sides and he was immersed in an ocean of soldiers. They surrounded him from all sides with an army of chariots. They angrily released a storm of arrows towards that supreme archer. But in that great battle, Satyaki, with truth as his valour, single-handedly defeated fifty enemy princes who had advanced against him. He penetrated the midst of the Bharata soldiers, which resounded with the noise of the slapping of palms. It was like an ocean, with the many swords, lances and clubs as boats. In that battle, we then witnessed the extraordinary conduct of Shini’s descendant. We saw him in the western direction and then in the east. We beheld his dexterity. He seemed to extend in the north, the south, the east and the west. The brave one seemed to be dancing around, as if he was one hundred rathas alone. On witnessing the conduct of the one whose gait was like that of a brave lion, the Trigartas were tormented and retreated towards their own kin. The brave Shurasenas then strove to counter him in that battle. <a id="calibre_link-3184" class="calibre2"></a>They released a storm of arrows on him, like a crazy elephant being urged with a goad. Satyaki took only a short instant to counter all of them and then began to fight with the Kalingas. His strength and valour were unthinkable. He passed that army of Kalingas, which was incapable of being crossed.</p>

O one who has truth as his valour! He is your disciple and your friend. The bull among men has conquered all the warriors, regarding them as grass. He has created terrible carnage among the Kourava warriors. O Kiriti! Satyaki is approaching and he is dearer to you than your own life. O Phalguna! Satyaki is approaching and he has used his arrows to crush Drona and Bhoja Kritavarma. He is devoted to ensuring Dharmaraja’s welfare and has killed the supreme among the best of warriors. O Phalguna! Satyaki is approaching. He is brave and skilled in the use of weapons. The immensely strong one has performed extremely difficult deeds in the midst of the soldiers. O Pandava! Satyaki is approaching, wishing to see you. He has fought with many maharathas, with the preceptor at the forefront, on a single chariot. O Partha! Satyaki is arriving. Depending on the strength of his own arms, he has shattered the army. He has been sent by the son of Dharma. O Partha! Satyaki is approaching. Among the Kouravas, there is no warrior who is equal to him. O Kounteya! Satyaki, for whom truth is his valour, is arriving. He has been freed from the Kuru soldiers, like a lion from amidst cattle. He has killed many soldiers. O Partha! Satyaki is approaching. He has strewn the earth with the faces, as beautiful as lotuses, of a thousand kings. O Partha! Satyaki is swiftly approaching. He has defeated Duryodhana and his brothers in the battle and has killed Jalasandha. Satyaki is swiftly arriving. He has created a river of blood, with blood as the mud, and has regarded the Kouravyas as grass. Satyaki is arriving.’ However, Kounteya was not happy and spoke <a id="calibre_link-3186" class="calibre2"></a>these words to Keshava. ‘O mighty-armed one! I do not find this arrival of Satyaki’s to be pleasant. O Keshava! I do not know about the state Dharmaraja is in. Without Satvata, I do not know whether he is alive or not. O mighty-armed one! He should have protected the king. O Krishna! Why has he abandoned him and followed in my footsteps? The king has been left to Drona and Saindhava has not yet been brought down. In the battle, Bhurishrava is advancing against Shini’s descendant. A greater burden than that of Saindhava has now been imposed on me. I should find out about the king and I should also protect Satyaki. I must also kill Jayadratha and the sun is low.

Krishna spoke to the mighty-armed Arjuna. ‘Behold. The tiger of the Vrishni and Andhaka lineages has succumbed to Somadatta’s son.

<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3196">‘“O bull among the Bharata lineage! At that time, a giant lamentation arose among the soldiers. The mighty-armed one<a id="calibre_link-738" href="#calibre_link-301" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">394</sup></a> struck and brought Satyaki down on the ground. Bhuridakshina, the best of the Kurus, dragged the foremost of the Satvata lineage, like a lion dragging an elephant and looked beautiful in the battle. In that encounter, Bhurishrava unsheathed his sword and grasping him by the hair, struck him in the chest with his foot. O king! On seeing that Satvata was thus being dragged in the battle, Vasudeva again spoke to Arjuna. ‘Behold. The tiger among the Vrishnis and the Andhakas has succumbed to Somadatta’s son. O mighty-armed one! He is your student and he is not inferior to you in archery. O Partha! Truth is Satyaki’s valour. But in this battle, Varshneya’s <a id="calibre_link-3197" class="calibre2"></a>valour has been rendered false by Bhurishrava.’ Having been thus addressed by Vasudeva in the battle, the mighty-armed Pandava mentally worshipped Bhurishrava and said, ‘I am glad that the extender of the deeds of the Kuru lineage is only dragging the best of the Satvata lineage in this battle and sporting with him. He has not killed Satyaki, the foremost among the brave ones of the Vrishni lineage. He is dragging him, like the king of deer dragging a giant elephant in the forest.’ O king! Having thus worshipped Kourava in his mind, the mighty-armed Partha Arjuna replied to Vasudeva, ‘O Madhava! Since my sight was fixed on Saindhava, I did not see anything else. For the sake of the Yadava, I will perform an extremely difficult task.’ Having spoken these words to Vasudeva, Pandava used an arrow to sever the arm, which held the sword, of the one who was devoted to sacrifices.”’<a id="calibre_link-739" href="#calibre_link-302" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">395</sup></a></p>

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3199">‘Sanjaya said, “The arm, with the sword and with a beautiful armlet, fell down on the ground and this caused supreme grief in the world of living beings. Kiriti severed the arm while he was still unseen and it fell down on the ground with great force, like a five-headed serpent. Having seen that he had been rendered unsuccessful by Partha, Kourava let go of Satyaki and angrily censured Pandava. ‘O Kounteya! You have performed an extremely cruel deed. While unseen by me and without engaging with me, you have severed my arm. What will you tell King Yudhishthira, the son of dharma? “I killed Bhurishrava in the battle, though he was not fighting with me.” Is this what the great-minded Indra instructed you himself? O Partha! Are these the weapons you learnt from Rudra, Drona and Kripa? It is said that you know more about dharma than anyone else in this world. How did you strike someone who was not engaged with you in battle? Learned ones do not strike someone who is distracted, <a id="calibre_link-3200" class="calibre2"></a>frightened and without a chariot, or someone who seeks mercy or confronts a hardship. This is inferior conduct and is practised by men who are wicked. O Partha! How did you then perpetrate this extremely difficult deed? O Dhananjaya! Noble ones can easily perform deeds that are noble. But on this earth, noble ones find it extremely difficult to perform an ignoble act. O Partha! Men quickly pick up the deeds and conduct of those they consort with. This can be seen in you. You have been born in a lineage of kings and in particular, you are a Kouraveya. You were good in conduct and observed good vows. How could you have transgressed the dharma of kshatriyas? You have performed this wicked deed for the sake of Varshneya.<a id="calibre_link-740" href="#calibre_link-303" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">396</sup></a> This is no doubt because of Vasudeva’s counsel, though this is not worthy of you. Other than someone who is Krishna’s friend, which person can inflict such a hardship on someone who is distracted and is fighting with another person? The Vrishnis and the Andhakas are vile.<a id="calibre_link-741" href="#calibre_link-304" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">397</sup></a> They are naturally addicted to deeds that should be censured. O Partha! Why have you accepted them as a model?’ Having thus spoken, the mighty-armed and immensely illustrious one, who had a sacrificial altar on his banner, abandoned Satyaki in the battle. He decided to fast to death.<a id="calibre_link-742" href="#calibre_link-305" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">398</sup></a> The one with auspicious signs spread a bed of arrows with his left hand. He wished to go to Brahma’s world and offered his breath of life to the lord of the senses as an oblation. He fixed his eye on the sun and his mind on pure water. He meditated on the great Upanishad and united with yoga, became silent.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3201">‘“All the soldiers and all the men censured Krishna and Dhananjaya and applauded that bull among men. Though censured, the two Krishnas did not say anything unpleasant in reply. Though praised, the one with the sacrificial altar on his standard, was not pleased either. O king! Dhananjaya could not mentally tolerate that your sons should have uttered such words and spoke to them. O <a id="calibre_link-3202" class="calibre2"></a>descendant of the Bharata lineage! His words were not angry, but he wished to remind them. Phalguna, Pandu’s son, spoke these words. ‘All the kings know about my great vow. No one who is within the range of my arrows will be able to kill anyone on our side. O one with the sacrificial altar on your banner! Knowing this, you should not censure me. Without knowing about the nature of dharma, one should not censure someone else. You possessed weapons and you were about to kill the brave one from the Vrishni lineage in the battle.

With his left arm, he offered his severed right arm. O great king! Having heard Partha’s words, the immensely radiant one, with the sacrificial altar on his standard, remained silent and hung his head down. Arjuna said, ‘O Shala’s elder brother!<a id="calibre_link-745" href="#calibre_link-308" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">401</sup></a> The affection that I bear towards you is the same as the one I bear towards Dharmaraja, Bhima, Nakula, supreme among eloquent ones, and Sahadeva.

Bhuridakshina, Shala’s elder brother, had already been slain by Pandu’s son and was distracted. Satyaki wished to kill such an unblemished one. He was seated with his arm lopped off, like an elephant with a severed trunk. All the soldiers censured the extremely evil-minded one loudly. He was restrained by Krishna, the great-souled Partha, Bhima, the two protectors of the chariot wheels,<a id="calibre_link-747" href="#calibre_link-310" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">403</sup></a> Ashvatthama, Kripa, Karna, Vrishasena and Saindhava. <a id="calibre_link-3204" class="calibre2"></a>The soldiers loudly asked him not to kill the one who was devoted to his vows. However, Satyaki severed the head of the Indra among the Kouravas with his sword, though his arm had been severed in the battle by Partha and he was fasting to death. The soldiers did not applaud Satyaki’s deed. The extender of the Kuru lineage had already been slain by Arjuna. The siddhas, the charanas and men saw Bhurishrava, who was an equal of the thousand-eyed one, being killed in the battle, though he was fasting to death. Amazed at his deeds, the gods honoured him. The soldiers also took sides and debated in many ways. ‘This is not Varshneya’s crime. This is destiny. Therefore, we should not fall prey to anger. Anger causes misery for men. It was destined that the brave one would be killed and it is not for us to debate this. The creator has ordained that in this battle, he will meet his death through Satyaki.’</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3205">‘“Satyaki said, ‘You tell me that one should not kill someone who should not be killed. You speak about dharma and seem to be established in dharma. You wear the garments of dharma. Subhadra’s son was a child. He was bereft of weapons. When you slew him in the battle, where was your dharma then? At some time, I had insolently taken a pledge. While I was still alive, if someone flung me down in battle and kicked me with his feet in anger, I would slay that enemy, even if he were to adopt the vow of a sage. O ones with limited intelligence! I was struggling to counter him, with my arms and eyes intact. But you thought that I was already dead. O bulls among the Kurus! It is very proper that I should have countered him in this way. Out of affection towards me, Partha protected his pledge.<a id="calibre_link-748" href="#calibre_link-311" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">404</sup></a> But having severed his arm with the sword, he has deprived me.

He was sanctified with mantras. He was great in granting boons. He was illustrious. He had given away thousands of donations. He was like a sage who had gone to the forest. No one was happy at his death. He had dark blue eyes. He was a benefactor. He was brave. His eyes were red, like those of a pigeon. His head was severed, like that of a horse at a sacrifice and was then placed at the spot for oblations. In the great battle, his energy sanctified the weapon that had severed his head. He was the granter of boons. He was the recipient of boons.

Fulfilling his promise to Yudhishthira, the brave one passed through that ocean of soldiers.

<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3210">‘Sanjaya replied, “O king! Listen to the ancient account about the origin of Shini’s descendant and also that of Bhurishrava. O king! You are uncertain on that account. Atri had a son named Soma and Soma’s son was known as Budha. Budha had a single son named Pururava and his splendour was like that of the great Indra. Pururava’s son was Ayu and Ayu’s son was known as Nahusha. Nahusha’s son was Yayati, revered by the gods as a rajarshi. Through Devayani, Yayati had an eldest son named Yadu. A son named Devamidha was born in Yadu’s lineage. His son Shura was born in the Yadava lineage and was honoured in the three worlds. Shura’s descendant was the immensely illustrious Shouri<a id="calibre_link-751" href="#calibre_link-314" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">407</sup></a> Vasudeva, foremost among <a id="calibre_link-3211" class="calibre2"></a>men.

In his lineage, and equal to him in valour, was born a king named Shini. O king! At this time, a <em class="calibre4">svayamvara</em> was organized for the great-minded Devaka’s daughter.<a id="calibre_link-753" href="#calibre_link-316" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">409</sup></a> All the kshatriyas assembled there.

O king! On seeing Devaki on Shouri Shini’s chariot, the immensely energetic Somadatta, bull among men, could not tolerate this. O king! There was a wonderful and extraordinary battle between them and it lasted for half a day. Those two extremely strong ones engaged in a wrestling match, like that between Shakra and Prahlada. Somadatta was forcibly thrown down on the ground by Shini. He<a id="calibre_link-755" href="#calibre_link-318" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">411</sup></a> raised his sword, grasped him by the hair and kicked him with the foot, in the midst of thousands of kings who looked on in every direction. Then, overcome by compassion, he let him go and said, ‘Live.’ O venerable one! Having been reduced to that state, Somadatta was overcome by intolerance and sought the favours of Mahadeva. The lord Mahadeva, supreme among the granters of boons, was satisfied. He wished to gratify him with a boon and the king asked for the following boon. ‘O lord! I ask for a son who will strike down Shini’s descendant in the midst of thousands of kings and kick him with the foot in a battle.’ Having heard the words of King Somadatta, the god agreed that it would be this way and disappeared. It was because of the boon that he obtained Bhuridakshina, and Somadatta’s son brought down Shini’s descendant in the battle. O king! I have told you what you asked me. Satvata, bull among men, cannot be vanquished in an encounter.</p>

There is no one like that. There has been no one like that. Nor will there be anyone like that. They do not disrespect their kin and are devoted to the commands of the elders. In a battle, the gods, the asuras, the gandharvas, the yakshas, the serpents and the rakshasas cannot vanquish the brave ones of the Vrishni lineage, not to speak of men. They do not covet the possessions of brahmanas, the possessions of their elders or the possessions of their kin. They never covet the possessions of those who have protected them in times of distress. Though prosperous, they are not excessively attached.<a id="calibre_link-756" href="#calibre_link-319" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">412</sup></a> They are devoted to brahmanas and are truthful in speech.

One can bear Mount Meru or swim across the abode of makaras, but one cannot stand up in an encounter with the foremost among the Vrishnis. O lord!

There is only a little bit of the day left. Strike the enemy with torrents of arrows. O foremost among men! O Karna! Once the day is over, it is certain that victory will be ours.

Without Arjuna on this earth, his brothers and their followers will have no interest in remaining alive, even for an instant. O Karna! When the Pandaveyas are destroyed, we will enjoy the entire earth, with its mountains, forests and groves, bereft of thorns. O one who grants honours! It seems that destiny is against Partha. Without knowing about what should be done and what should not be done, he has taken a pledge in this battle. O Karna! There is no doubt that Kiriti Pandava has taken this vow about killing Jayadratha for the sake of his own destruction. O Radheya! When an invincible one like you is alive, how will Phalguna be able to kill King Saindhava before the sun has set? He is protected by the <a id="calibre_link-3219" class="calibre2"></a>king of Madra and the great-souled Kripa. How will Dhananjaya be able to kill Jayadratha in the forefront of the battle?

O one who grants honours! There is no doubt that Partha will not be able to approach Jayadratha. O Karna! With me and the other brave maharathas, fight against Partha in the battle and carefully make supreme efforts.’ O venerable one!

In the battle, he has wounded me grievously with many nets of arrows. O one who grants honours! I have nevertheless been stationed in this battle. There is not a single limb of mine that has not been tormented by arrows in the encounter. O king!

The king of Madra pierced Kounteya with thirty arrows. Sharadvata’s son struck Vasudeva with twenty and struck Dhananjaya with twelve arrows that had been sharpened on stone. O great king! The king of Sindhu struck Krishna and Partha separately with four arrows and Vrishasena struck them separately with seven. In that fashion, Kunti’s son, Dhananjaya, pierced them back. He pierced Drona’s son with sixty-four and the king of Madra with one hundred. He struck Saindhava with ten broad-headed arrows and Vrishasena with three arrows. Partha struck Sharadvata’s son with twenty arrows and roared. Desiring to render Savyasachi’s pledge <a id="calibre_link-3228" class="calibre2"></a>unsuccessful, all those on your side united and quickly attacked Dhananjaya. At this, Arjuna used a weapon that was sharp on all sides and created terror among the sons of Dhritarashtra. The Kurus were on extremely expensive chariots. They advanced against Pandu’s son and showered down torrents of arrows.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3229">‘“O descendant of the Bharata lineage! A tumultuous and extremely terrible encounter commenced and it caused confusion. But the prince,<a id="calibre_link-768" href="#calibre_link-331" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">424</sup></a> with a diadem and a garland, did not lose his senses and continued to shoot arrows. Desiring the kingdom and remembering the twelve years of hardship suffered because of the Kurus, the great-souled and immeasurable Savyasachi released arrows from Gandiva and covered all the directions. The sky seemed to be covered with flaming meteors. Many crows descended on the dead bodies. The one with the diadem and the garland angrily killed his enemies, like the one with the tawny bowstring using Ajagava.<a id="calibre_link-769" href="#calibre_link-332" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">425</sup></a> The great one with the diadem and the garland was immensely illustrious. With his bow and arrows, he was the conqueror of armies. With his arrows, he brought down the brave ones among the Kurus, astride their supreme horses and elephants. In that encounter, many kings picked up heavy clubs, iron bludgeons, swords and spears. They grasped those large weapons and assuming fierce forms, suddenly attacked Partha. But the great archer destroyed them, with their chariots, horses, elephants and masses of foot soldiers. In that encounter, the brave one deprived them of their weapons and their lives and extended Yama’s kingdom.”’</p>
<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-3230">Chapter 1098(121)</h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3231">‘Sanjaya said, “Dhananjaya was seen to roam around in that battle and he seemed to be simultaneously everywhere. He <a id="calibre_link-3232" class="calibre2"></a>exhibited his wonderful weapons. He was like the midday sun, scorching everything from the sky. None of the beings were capable of glancing at Pandava. A torrent of arrows issued from the great-souled one’s Gandiva. In that battle, they seemed to be like an array of swans in the sky. He countered all those brave ones with his weapons. Through his fierce deeds, he exhibited his terrible self. O king! Arjuna passed all those rathas and confounded them with his iron arrows, wishing to kill Jayadratha. With his charioteer, Dhananjaya was seen to swiftly course around in that field of battle, releasing arrows in all the directions. Hundreds and thousands of arrows were shot by the brave and great-souled one and these torrents traversed the sky and made it invisible. The great archer picked up an arrow, affixed it and shot it. But we did not notice any gap between Kounteya Pandava doing these. O king! Having covered all the directions and having afflicted all the rathas in that battle, Kounteya attacked Jayadratha. He pierced him with sixty-four arrows with straight tufts. Saindhava was thus pierced by arrows shot by the wielder of Gandiva. He became extremely enraged, like an elephant struck by a goad, and could not tolerate this. The one with the boar on his banner<a id="calibre_link-770" href="#calibre_link-333" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">426</sup></a> used arrows that were tufted with the feathers of vultures. They were like venomous serpents and had been prepared by artisans. In that battle, he released these sharp arrows towards Savyasachi. He pierced Gandiva with three arrows and struck Arjuna with six iron arrows. He pierced his horses with eight arrows and his standard with one. Arjuna countered the arrows shot by Saindhava with his own sharp arrows. Simultaneously, with a couple of arrows, he severed the head of Saindhava’s charioteer from his body and brought down the well-ornamented standard. The king of Sindhu’s standard was marked with the sign of a boar and was extremely large. Its pole was broken and it was shattered by those arrows. It fell down, like a fiery flame.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3233">‘“Meanwhile, the sun was descending quickly. Janardana hastily spoke to Pandava. ‘O Dhananjaya! Cut off the head of the <a id="calibre_link-3234" class="calibre2"></a>evil-souled Saindhava. The sun is about to set on Asta, the best of mountains. But listen to the words I have to say about killing Jayadratha. Saindhava’s father, Vriddhakshatra, is famous in the world. He obtained Jayadratha Saindhava, the scorcher of enemies, as his son after a long period of time and an invisible voice, with a rumbling tone like that of the clouds, spoke to the king then. “O lord! In this world, your son will possess lineage, conduct and qualities that are equal to those of two lineages.<a id="calibre_link-771" href="#calibre_link-334" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">427</sup></a> He will be foremost among kshatriyas in the world and will be revered by brave ones. But when he is fighting against an enemy in a battle, that enemy archer, famous on earth, will sever his head.” Having heard this, the king of Sindhu, the scorcher of enemies, reflected for a long time. Afflicted by affection towards his son, he summoned all his relatives and told them, “The person who fights with my son in an encounter and brings his head down on the ground will bear a great burden. There is no doubt that his head will shatter into a hundred fragments.” Having said this, he established Jayadratha on the throne. Vriddhakshatra went to the forest and immersed himself in austerities. The energetic one is still tormenting himself with terrible and extremely difficult austerities. O one with the ape on your banner! He is just outside Samantapanchaka.<a id="calibre_link-772" href="#calibre_link-335" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">428</sup></a> O slayer of enemies! Therefore, once you have severed Jayadratha’s head in this great battle, use your divine weapons that are terrible and perform wonderful deeds. O younger brother of the son of the wind god! O descendant of the Bharata lineage! With its earrings, quickly convey the head of the king of Sindhu to Vriddhakshatra’s lap and bring it down there. If you bring his head down on the ground, there is no doubt about the consequence that your head will shatter into a hundred fragments. O best of the Kurus! Resort to your divine weapons and do this, so that the king,<a id="calibre_link-773" href="#calibre_link-336" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">429</sup></a> the lord of the earth, does <a id="calibre_link-3235" class="calibre2"></a>not know. O son of Vasava! There is no deed in the three worlds that you cannot perform.’ Having heard these words, he<a id="calibre_link-774" href="#calibre_link-337" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">430</sup></a> licked the corners of his mouth.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3236">‘“He used mantras to invoke a divine weapon that was like Indra’s vajra to the touch. He used an arrow that was capable of bearing a great load and had always been worshipped with fragrances and garlands. To bring about Jayadratha’s death, Arjuna quickly released it. Released from Gandiva, that arrow was as swift as a hawk snatching a bird from the top of a tree. It severed Saindhava’s head. With other arrows, Dhananjaya bore it up again,<a id="calibre_link-775" href="#calibre_link-338" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">431</sup></a> thus causing grief to his ill-wishers and delight to his well-wishers. At that time, Pandava made the head look like a <em class="calibre4">kadamba</em> flower and used arrows to convey it to Samantapanchaka. O venerable one! The energetic King Vriddhakshatra, with whom you have a matrimonial alliance,<a id="calibre_link-776" href="#calibre_link-339" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">432</sup></a> was engaged in his evening prayers then. He was seated. The head of the king of Sindhu, with dark hair and earrings, was thrown down on his lap. The head, with its beautiful earrings, was brought down on his lap. O scorcher of enemies! But King Vriddhakshatra did not notice it. When the intelligent Vriddhakshatra stood up, after having finished his meditation, the head was suddenly flung down on the ground. O scorcher of enemies! As soon as his son’s head fell down on the ground, the king’s head shattered into a hundred fragments. At this, all the beings were overcome by supreme wonder. All of them praised Vasudeva and maharatha Bibhatsu.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3237">‘“On seeing that Jayadratha, the king of Sindhu, had been killed, your sons were miserable and their eyes filled with tears. So that Pandava<a id="calibre_link-777" href="#calibre_link-340" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">433</sup></a> might know, in that battle, Bhimasena roared loudly like a lion and filled up heaven and earth.<a id="calibre_link-778" href="#calibre_link-341" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">434</sup></a> On hearing that loud roar, Yudhishthira, Dharma’s son, understood that Saindhava had been killed by the great-souled Phalguna. He sounded musical instruments <a id="calibre_link-3238" class="calibre2"></a>and delighted his warriors. Wishing to fight, he advanced in the battle against Bharadvaja’s son. O king! After the sun had set, a battle commenced between Drona and the Somakas and it made the body hair stand up. O king! After Saindhava was slain, those maharathas made every effort to kill Bharadvaja’s son. When Saindhava was slain, the Pandavas obtained victory. Intoxicated with victory, they fought with Drona. O great king! Having killed King Saindhava, in that encounter, Arjuna also fought with the supreme of rathas and warriors on your side. The one with the diadem and the garland was like the king of the gods, fighting with the enemies of the gods and slaughtered them, like the rising sun destroying darkness. The brave one fulfilled the pledge he had taken earlier.”’</p>

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3248">‘Dhritarashtra asked, “O Sanjaya! After the brave Saindhava was killed by Savyasachi, what did those on my side do? Tell me that.”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3249">‘Sanjaya replied, “O venerable one! On seeing that Saindhava had been killed in the battle by Partha, Kripa, Sharadvata’s son, was overcome by great intolerance. He covered Pandava with a great shower of arrows. Drona’s son also stationed himself on his chariot and attacked Partha Phalguna. Those two best of rathas were stationed on two chariots that were supreme among chariots. They showered down sharp arrows from both sides. The mighty-armed one, supreme among rathas, was afflicted by that great shower of arrows and felt extreme pain. But in that battle, he did not wish to slay his preceptor or his preceptor’s son.<a id="calibre_link-2017" href="#calibre_link-1369" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">1</sup></a> Kunti’s son, Dhananjaya, then began to act like a preceptor there.<a id="calibre_link-2018" href="#calibre_link-1370" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">2</sup></a> He countered the weapons of Drona’s son and Sharadvata’s son with his weapons. However, since he did not wish to kill them, he released arrows at them that were <a id="calibre_link-3250" class="calibre2"></a>only mild in speed. But though he did not shoot them powerfully, the many arrows shot by Jaya caused supreme difficulties and they were overcome by those arrows. O king! Oppressed by Kounteya’s arrows, Sharadvata’s son sat down on the floor of his chariot and lost his consciousness. On seeing that his master was unconscious and was afflicted by arrows, his charioteer thought that he was dead and bore him away. O great king! After Kripa, Sharadvata’s son, had been taken away from the field of battle, Ashvatthama also took to his chariot and fled from Pandaveya.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3251">‘“Seeing that Sharadvata’s son was unconscious and afflicted by arrows, the great archer, Partha, lamented miserably on his chariot. ‘The immensely wise Kshatta<a id="calibre_link-2019" href="#calibre_link-1371" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">3</sup></a> had foreseen this and had spoken to the king, as soon as the wicked Suyodhana, the exterminator of his lineage, was born. “Let this destroyer of the lineage be conveyed to the world of the hereafter. Because of him, the foremost ones of the Kuru lineage will confront a great calamity.” Those words, spoken by the one who tells the truth, have come true. It is because of his deeds that I see Kripa lying on a bed of arrows. Shame on the dharma of kshatriyas! Shame on strength and manliness! Is there anyone like me, raising his weapons against a brahmana, especially one who is a preceptor? He is the son of a rishi. He is the beloved friend of my preceptor, Drona. He is lying down on the floor of his chariot, afflicted by my arrows. Though I did not desire it, my arrows have severely wounded him. He has sunk down on the floor of his chariot and this causes pain to my heart. Even though he afflicted me with arrows, I should only have looked at that immensely radiant one.<a id="calibre_link-2020" href="#calibre_link-1372" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">4</sup></a> Struck by my numerous arrows, he has attained the state that everyone must duly obtain.<a id="calibre_link-2021" href="#calibre_link-1373" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">5</sup></a> I am overcome by greater sorrow than from the death of my son. O Krishna! Behold the miserable state he has been reduced to on his chariot. Those bulls among men, who obtain knowledge from their preceptors, and then give them what they desire, attain divinity. But the worst of men, who obtain <a id="calibre_link-3252" class="calibre2"></a>knowledge from their preceptors, and then strike them, are of evil conduct and go to hell. There is no doubt that my deed today will take me to hell, since my preceptor, Kripa, was on his chariot and I have covered him with arrows. When he had instructed me about weapons earlier, Kripa had said, “O Kouravya! Do not ever strike your preceptor.” I have not obeyed the words of my great-souled preceptor. I have struck him with a shower of arrows. I bow down and worship Goutama, who does not retreat. O Varshneya! Shame on me for having struck him.’ While Savyasachi was thus lamenting, Radheya saw that Saindhava had been killed and attacked him.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3253">‘“On seeing that Radheya was advancing, maharatha Partha laughed and spoke these words to Devaki’s son.<a id="calibre_link-2022" href="#calibre_link-1374" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">6</sup></a> ‘Adhiratha’s son is advancing towards Satyaki’s chariot. There is no doubt that he cannot tolerate Bhurishrava’s death in the battle. O Janardana! Urge the horses towards the spot where he is going. Let not Vrisha make Satyaki follow in the footsteps of Somadatta’s son.’ Having been thus addressed by Savyasachi, the mighty-armed and immensely energetic Keshava spoke words that were appropriate to the occasion. ‘O Pandava! The mighty-armed one is alone enough for Karna. In addition, the bull among the Satvata lineage is with Droupadi’s sons. O Partha! It is not proper for you to fight with Karna now. O destroyer of enemy heroes! He possesses the blazing weapon that was given to him by Vasava.<a id="calibre_link-2023" href="#calibre_link-1375" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">7</sup></a> It is like a giant meteor. He worships it and has preserved it for you. Therefore, let Karna proceed to the spot where Satvata is. O Kouravya! I know when the time will come for the evil-souled one.’”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3254">‘Dhritarashtra said, “O Sanjaya! Tell me about the clash between the brave Karna and Varshneya, which took place after Bhurishrava and Saindhava had been brought down. Satyaki was without a chariot. Which chariot did he mount? Also tell me about the two Panchalas<a id="calibre_link-2024" href="#calibre_link-1376" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">8</sup></a> who protected the chariot wheels.”</p>

Janardana knows the past and the future. O king!

Listen to the battle, as it happened. On seeing that Satyaki was without a chariot and Karna was attacking him with raised weapons, Madhava blew a rishabha note on his conch shell with great force.<a id="calibre_link-2028" href="#calibre_link-1380" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">12</sup></a> From the sound of that conch shell, Daruka got the message. He took that chariot, with Suparna<a id="calibre_link-2029" href="#calibre_link-1381" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">13</sup></a> decorating the standard. With Keshava’s permission, Daruka yoked the chariot, which was like the fire or the sun, and made Shini’s grandson ascend it. It could go wherever one wished and it was drawn by Sainya, Sugriva, Meghapushpa and Balahaka.<a id="calibre_link-2030" href="#calibre_link-1382" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">14</sup></a> It possessed a great speed and was decorated with gold. He ascended that chariot, which was like a celestial vehicle<a id="calibre_link-2031" href="#calibre_link-1383" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">15</sup></a> and which had been yoked.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3257">‘“He attacked Radheya and showered down many arrows on him. The two protectors of the chariot wheels, Yudhamanyu and Uttamouja, also abandoned Dhananjaya’s chariot and attacked Radheya. O great king! Radheya also showered down arrows. In that battle, he angrily attacked Shini’s undecaying grandson. The gods, the gandharvas, the asuras, the serpents and the rakshasas have not <a id="calibre_link-3258" class="calibre2"></a>heard of such a battle having taken place in heaven or on earth earlier. O great king! On witnessing their deeds, the soldiers, the rathas, the horses, the men and the elephants were senseless with wonder and became spectators, witnessing those superhuman exploits. O king! They withdrew and also watched Daruka’s skill as a charioteer. He moved forward and back, executed circular motions and retreated. The charioteer of that chariot, descended from Kashyapa’s lineage, caused great wonder.<a id="calibre_link-2032" href="#calibre_link-1384" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">16</sup></a> The gods, the gandharvas and the danavas assembled in the sky, to watch that encounter between Karna and Shini’s descendant with great attention. For the sake of their friends, those two powerful ones vigorously challenged each other in that battle. O great king! Karna, who was like an immortal, and Yuyudhana Satyaki showered down arrows on each other. Unable to tolerate the death of Kouravya Jalasandha,<a id="calibre_link-2033" href="#calibre_link-1385" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">17</sup></a> Karna ground Shini’s descendant down with a shower of arrows. Overcome by anger, Karna sighed like a giant serpent. In that encounter, his angry glances seemed to burn up Shini’s descendant. The scorcher of enemies repeatedly attacked him, with great force. On seeing that he was in great rage, Satyaki pierced him back with a great shower of arrows, like an elephant countering another elephant. Those two tigers among men clashed, as spirited as tigers. In that battle, unparalleled in valour, they wounded each other. Shini’s grandson, the scorcher of enemies, repeatedly pierced Karna, all over his limbs, with arrows that were completely made out of iron. With a broad-headed arrow, he brought down his charioteer from his seat on the chariot. He killed the four white horses with sharp arrows. The bull among men shattered his standard into a hundred fragments with a hundred arrows. O king! On seeing that Karna was without a chariot, your sons and the bulls among men on your side were distressed.</p>

Seeing that the <a id="calibre_link-3260" class="calibre2"></a>brave son of the suta had been deprived of his chariot by Satyaki, a great lamentation arose from all the soldiers. O king! Having been oppressed by Satvata’s arrows, Karna was also benumbed. O king! He ascended Duryodhana’s chariot and sighed deeply. He remembered the respect he bore towards your son, the affection since childhood and the promise that he had made about returning the kingdom to him. O king! When Karna was deprived of his chariot, your brave sons, with Duhshasana at the forefront, succumbed to Satyaki. But he did not kill them, to protect the pledge that Bhimasena had taken earlier. He deprived them of their chariots and made them senseless, but did not take their lives away from them. Bhimasena had taken a pledge to kill your sons and at the time of the second gambling match, so had Partha<a id="calibre_link-2034" href="#calibre_link-1386" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">18</sup></a> about killing Karna. With Karna at the forefront, though they made efforts to kill Satyaki, supreme among rathas, they did not succeed in killing him. With a single bow, he defeated Drona’s son, Kritavarma, other maharathas and hundreds of bulls among the kshatriyas. Satyaki, the destroyer of enemies, possessed a valour that was like that of the two Krishnas and for the sake of attaining to the afterworld and to do that which would bring pleasure to Dharmaraja. O tiger among men! In this world, there are only three archers&mdash;Krishna, Partha and Shini’s descendant. No fourth one can be seen.”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3261">‘Dhritarashtra said, “Saytaki ascended Vasudeva’s invincible chariot. The young one, who is Vasudeva’s equal, deprived Karna of his chariot. He was proud because of the strength of his own arms and that chariot was yoked by Daruka. Did Satyaki then climb onto another chariot? I wish to hear this and you are skilled in recounting. O Sanjaya! Tell me that. I think that he is impossible to withstand.”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3262">‘Sanjaya replied, “O king! Listen to what happened. Daruka’s immensely intelligent younger brother quickly brought another chariot that had been prepared in the proper fashion. The pole was of iron and gold and was tied with cloth. There was a lion on the standard, decorated with a thousand stars. The horses were as fast <a id="calibre_link-3263" class="calibre2"></a>as the wind and possessed golden harnesses. They were as white as the moon. The chariot was firm and its speed was beyond that of sound. O lord of the earth! Those were the best of horses and they were colourful with gold. There was the sound of nets of bells and the lances and spears were like lightning. It was stocked with implements of war and many weapons and garments. That chariot rumbled like the roar of the clouds and it was prepared. Ascending this, Shini’s descendant attacked your soldiers. Following his desire, Daruka went to where Keshava was. O great king! The best of chariots was also brought for Karna. There were well-trained horses that had a great speed and they were as white as conch shells or milk. The harnesses were colourful and golden. The sides and standard were made out of gold and there were machines and flags. There were many weapons and garments and there was a good charioteer. Ascending this chariot, Karna rushed against the enemy again. This is the entire account, as you have asked me to recount it. Know about the great destruction that was brought about because of your bad policy. Thirty-one of your sons were brought down by Bhimasena. With Durmukha at the forefront, they were colourful in fighting.<a id="calibre_link-2035" href="#calibre_link-1387" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">19</sup></a> O venerable one! Hundreds of brave ones were killed by Satvata and Arjuna, with Bhishma and Bhagadatta as the foremost. O king! This was the destruction that was brought about by your evil counsel.”’</p>

<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3266">‘Sanjaya replied, “After Bhimasena was rendered without a chariot and made to suffer the stakes that were Karna’s words, he was overcome by great intolerance and spoke these words to Phalguna. <a id="calibre_link-3267" class="calibre2"></a>‘O Dhananjaya! While you looked on, Karna repeatedly told me that I was a eunuch and stupid and that I was a glutton. He said that I did not possess skills with a weapon and that I should not fight. He said that I was a child who got distressed in battle. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! Someone who speaks to me in this way will be killed by me. O mighty-armed one! You know the vows that you and I have taken together. O Kounteya! There is no doubt that what they mean to you, are also what they mean to me.<a id="calibre_link-2036" href="#calibre_link-1388" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">20</sup></a> O best of men! Remembering my words, kill him. O Dhananjaya! Act so that your pledge comes true.’</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3268">‘“Having heard the words of the infinitely valorous Bhima, Arjuna advanced towards Karna in that battle and spoke to him. ‘O Karna! O Karna! O son of a suta! Your sight is useless. You praise yourself. O one whose intelligence is based on adharma! Listen to what I am going to tell you now. There are two outcomes brave ones face in a battle, victory or defeat. O Radheya! That is always the case, even if Vasava himself were to fight. You were rendered close to death by Yuyudhana. You were without a chariot and exposed. Through chance, you deprived Bhimasena of his chariot. O Radheya! But the words that you spoke to Bhima were adharma. The brave ones who know about the dharma of fighting protect, to the best of their capacity, those who are running away at the end of a battle. In the battle, when all the soldiers looked on and so did Keshava and I, there were several occasions when Bhimasena robbed you of a chariot. However, the descendant of the Pandu lineage did not utter a single harsh word to you. But you made Vrikodara hear many harsh words. And when he was not in my sight, you killed Subhadra’s son. You will reap the fruits of those offences today. O evil-minded one! It was for your own destruction that you severed his<a id="calibre_link-2037" href="#calibre_link-1389" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">21</sup></a> bow then. O foolish one! You will be killed by me, with your servants, soldiers and mounts. Do everything that you wish to, because a great calamity confronts you. In your very sight, I will kill Vrishasena<a id="calibre_link-2038" href="#calibre_link-1390" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">22</sup></a> in this battle. If any of these <a id="calibre_link-3269" class="calibre2"></a>other kings are confused in their intelligence and advance against me, I will kill all of them. I swear this truthfully, on my weapons. You are stupid and devoid of wisdom. But you pride yourself in this battle. On seeing you brought down, the wicked Duryodhana will lament grievously.’ When Arjuna swore that he would kill Karna’s son, a great and tumultuous uproar arose among all the rathas. There was great fear in that fierce battle. The rays of the thousand-rayed one became dim as it approached the mountain.<a id="calibre_link-2039" href="#calibre_link-1391" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">23</sup></a></p>

It is through good fortune that your great vow has been accomplished. It is through good fortune that the wicked Vriddhakshatra has been slain, together with his son. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! Confronting the army of the sons of Dhritarashtra in battle, even the army of the gods would lose its senses. O Jishnu! One should not doubt this. O tiger among men! Even if I think about it, I do not see any other man in the worlds who is your equal, in terms of fighting with this army. There are many who are extremely powerful, your equals and superiors. These lords of the earth have assembled because of the son of Dhritarashtra. They are armoured. But they could not advance against your angry person in the battle. Your valour and strength are like that of Rudra and the Destroyer. There is no one else who could have exhibited such valour in battle. O unblemished one! O scorcher of enemies! There is no one like you and you accomplished this alone. Once the evil-minded Karna has been killed, with his followers, and you have defeated and slain that enemy, I will praise you even more.’ Arjuna replied, ‘O Madhava! It is through your favours that this vow of mine has been accomplished. It was one that even the gods would have found difficult to fulfil. O Madhava! This victory is not a surprise for those who have you as a protector. It is through your favours that Yudhishthira will obtain the entire earth. O Varshneya! O lord! This is because of your power. This victory is yours. O Madhusudana! Our prosperity has been brought by you.’ Having been thus addressed, <a id="calibre_link-3271" class="calibre2"></a>Krishna smiled gently and urged the steeds slowly, showing Partha the field of battle, in all its cruelty.</p>

Their weapons and ornaments are strewn around. Horses, chariots and elephants are in distress. Their armour has been shattered and they are faced with great grief. Some are still alive. Others have lost their lives. But even the kings who are dead seem to be alive because of the supreme radiance that they possess. Their arrows are gold-tufted and they have many sharp weapons. Look. The earth is covered with mounts and weapons. There are armour, shields, garlands and heads decorated with earrings. There are headdresses and crowns, garlands of flowers and jewels that are worn on crowns. There are strings around the neck and armlets, extremely radiant and made out of gold. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! There are many other colourful ornaments that make the earth beautiful. There are fans and whisks and colourful standards, horses, chariots and elephants. Many cushions from the horses are scattered around. There are different kinds of carpets and extremely expensive bumpers. Behold. The earth is littered with these and looks like a picture. Those who rode on elephants have been fallen down, along with the elephants. They look like lions that have been dislodged from mountain peaks by thunder. Look at the others. There are horse riders on the earth, together with the horses. There are large numbers of foot soldiers and infantry, their bodies covered with wounds.’ Having shown Kiriti the field of battle, Krishna blew on Panchajanya, delighting those who had assembled on their side.”’</p>

Wiping it, he spoke to Vasudeva and Pandava Dhananjaya. ‘O maharathas! It is through good fortune that I see you after you have accomplished this burden in the battle. It is through good fortune that the wicked Saindhava, worst of men, has been killed. O Krishna! It is through good fortune that you have brought me this great delight. It is through good fortune that large numbers of the enemy are immersed in an ocean of grief. There is nothing in the worlds that is impossible for you. O Madhusudana!

Whether it is the conquest of the earth or whether it is the conquest of the three worlds, it is certain that those who satisfy you will be successful in that. O lord of the lord of the gods! Those who satisfy you do not obtain sin, nor are they defeated in battle. O Hrishikesha! It is through your favours that Shakra became the lord of the gods, obtained prosperity and succeeded in conquering the three worlds in the field of battle. O lord of the thirty gods! O Krishna! It is through your favours that the thirty gods obtained immortality and enjoyed the eternal worlds. O destroyer of enemies!

He who attains you, obtains happiness.’ Having been thus addressed, the great-souled Keshava and Pandava cheerfully replied to the king, the lord of the earth. ‘The wicked King Jayadratha has been burnt in the fire of your anger. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! The army of the sons of Dhritarashtra is extremely great. But in the battle, it is decaying. It has been struck, slain and destroyed. O destroyer of enemies! The Kouravas are being destroyed because of your anger. O brave one! The evil-minded Duryodhana has enraged you. With his friends and relatives, he will give up his life in this battle, destroyed by your sight. Earlier, because of your anger, Bhishma, the grandfather of the Kurus and extremely difficult for even the gods to defeat, was struck and made to lie down on a bed of arrows. O destroyer of enemies! It will be extremely difficult for them to obtain victory in this battle. O Pandava! Because of your wrath, they have come under the clutches of death. O granter of honours! One who enrages you will soon have his kingdom, life, dear ones, sons and all kinds of happiness destroyed. O Yudhishthira! You have always been devoted to the dharma of kings.

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3291">‘Sanjaya said, “Thus urged by Drona, King Duryodhana became overcome by intolerance and made up his mind to fight. Your son, Duryodhana, then spoke to Karna. ‘The vyuha constructed by the preceptor is extremely impenetrable, even to the gods. Behold. With Krishna as his aide, Pandava Kiriti penetrated it, while you were looking and the great-souled Drona was struggling and so were the foremost among warriors. He brought down Saindhava. O Radheya! Look. Kings of the earth, foremost among warriors, have single-handedly been killed by Partha, like inferior animals by a lion. O destroyer of enemies! In this battle, this happened while I was looking on. Shakra’s son has left only a little bit of my soldiers left. Despite Drona fighting and making the best of efforts in the <a id="calibre_link-3292" class="calibre2"></a>battle, how could Phalguna accomplish his desire and penetrate the extremely impenetrable vyuha? The great-souled preceptor has always loved Phalguna. O destroyer of enemies! That is the reason he granted him entry, without fighting with him. Drona, scorcher of enemies, offered assurance to Saindhava. He then allowed Kiriti to enter. Behold my bad luck. Had I permitted the king of Sindhu to leave for his home earlier, there would not have been this destruction of men in the battle. In the hope of remaining alive, Jayadratha wished to go home. But having obtained assurance from Drona in the battle, I restrained him. My warrior brothers, Chitrasena and the others, have encountered Bhimasena and were destroyed by him, while we evil-souled ones looked on.’</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3293">‘“Karna said, ‘Do not censure the preceptor. The brahmana is fighting to the best of his ability. In the battle, I do not think that Pandava can be defeated by Drona, though he is skilled in the use of weapons. That is the reason the one with the white horses<a id="calibre_link-2057" href="#calibre_link-1409" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">41</sup></a> has passed him and has penetrated. O Suyodhana! I think that anything determined by destiny can never be transgressed, even if we make endeavours and fight to the utmost of our strength. O king! With Saindhava killed in the battle, it seems that destiny is supreme. With you, we have made the utmost effort in the field of battle. All our manliness has been rendered futile by fate. We have always endeavoured, but our valour has been unsuccessful. Whenever a man performs an act, but is not favoured by destiny, fate destroys all his exertions. A man with perseverance must do whatever he has to do and must not have doubts about the act. Success depends on destiny. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! The Parthas were deprived through deceit and the use of poison.<a id="calibre_link-2058" href="#calibre_link-1410" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">42</sup></a> They were burnt in the house of lac<a id="calibre_link-2059" href="#calibre_link-1411" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">43</sup></a> and defeated in the gambling match. Using the principles of royal policy, they were exiled to the forest. Though all of this was undertaken with great care, it has been frustrated by destiny. Let us make efforts to fight and not turn our backs on death. <a id="calibre_link-3294" class="calibre2"></a>You and they will make efforts and traverse the path determined by destiny. It does not seem that they have done anything good by using superior intelligence. O extender of the Kuru lineage! O brave one! Nor is it the case that we have performed bad deeds because of inferior intelligence. Destiny determines the outcome, of good deeds and inferior ones. Fate has its own action and is awake when everyone else is asleep. When the war commenced, you had many soldiers and many warriors. The sons of Pandu had fewer, but have destroyed many strikers on your side. I think that this destruction of our manliness is the work of fate.’”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3295">‘Sanjaya said, “O lord of men! While they were talking a lot, the Pandava battle formations appeared in the battle. O king! Because of your evil cousel, an encounter commenced between those on your side and the others and chariots and elephants clashed against each other.”’</p>

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3297">‘Sanjaya said, “O lord of men! That army of yours had large numbers of horses and elephants. It fought everywhere, attacking the soldiers of the Pandus. The Panchalas and the Kurus fought against each other, having decided to go to the afterworld, the great kingdom of Yama. Brave ones clashed against brave ones and struck with arrows, lances and spears. They quickly sent each other to Yama’s abode. Rathas fought against rathas and caused fierce flowing of blood. There was a great battle and they killed each other. O great king! Crazy and intoxicated elephants clashed against each other and gored each other with tusks. In that tumultuous battle, horse riders desired great fame and killed horse riders with javelins, spears and battleaxes. O mighty-armed one! There were hundreds of foot soldiers, with weapons in their hands. O king! They dashed against each other, always enterprising in their valour. O venerable one! The lineages, names and families of the Panchalas and the Kurus could <a id="calibre_link-3298" class="calibre2"></a>only be deciphered through hearing.<a id="calibre_link-2060" href="#calibre_link-1412" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">44</sup></a> In that battle, the warriors attacked each other with arrows, spears and battleaxes. Wishing to send others to the afterworld, they roamed around fearlessly. O king! They released thousands of arrows in the ten directions, which were no longer illuminated, because the sun had set. O great king! When the Pandaveyas were fearlessly fighting, Duryodhana penetrated into their army. Because of Saindhava’s death, he was overcome by supreme grief. Thinking that life was mortal, he penetrated into the army of the enemy. Making the earth tremble with the roar of his chariot, your son attacked the Pandava army. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! That tumultuous clash between them and him caused a great destruction among all the soldiers. Just as the midday sun scorches with its rays, in their midst, your son tormented them with his shower of arrows. In that battle, the Pandavas were incapable of glancing at him. They were only interested in running away and lost all enthusiasm about defeating the enemy. Your great-souled and archer son used gold-tufted arrows that were dazzling at the tip. The Panchalas were slaughtered and fled. Afflicted by those arrows, the Pandu soldiers quickly began to fall down. O lord of the earth! In the battle, those on their side were incapable of performing deeds like those done by the king who was your son. In the encounter, the Pandava soldiers were crushed by your son, like lotuses by an elephant. They were like blooming lotuses destroyed by an elephant, ones that had lost their sheen because of the wind and the sun, once the water had dried up. Because of your son’s energy, the Pandava soldiers were like that.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3299">‘“O descendant of the Bharata lineage! On seeing that the Pandava soldiers were being killed by your son, the Panchalas attacked him, with Bhimasena at the forefront.

He pierced Satvata with five, each of <a id="calibre_link-3300" class="calibre2"></a>Droupadi’s sons with three and also piercing Ghatotkacha in that battle, roared like a lion. With arrows that were fierce at the tip, he brought down hundreds of other warriors, elephants, horses and chariots in that battle, like an angry Destroyer slaughtering beings. His large bow had a golden back. O venerable one! As he was striking down enemies with this, the eldest of the Pandavas<a id="calibre_link-2062" href="#calibre_link-1414" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">46</sup></a> severed it into three fragments with two broad-headed arrows. He then pierced him with ten powerful and sharp arrows. These passed through all his inner organs and having mangled him, entered the ground. The warriors who were around Yudhishthira were delighted, like the gods surrounding Purandara after Vritra had been killed. O venerable one! Then, King Yudhishthira, who is supremely difficult to repulse, dispatched an arrow towards your son in that battle. Severely wounded by this, he sat down on his supreme chariot. O Indra among kings! At this, a great noise arose from the Panchala soldiers. ‘The king has been killed,’ they shouted in delight. O venerable one! The fierce sound of arrows was heard there. In that battle, Drona quickly showed himself. Cheerfully, Duryodhana grasped his bow firmly and asking the Pandava king to wait, attacked him. Wishing to seize the king,<a id="calibre_link-2063" href="#calibre_link-1415" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">47</sup></a> the Panchalas swiftly attacked back. Wishing to save the supreme among the Kurus, Drona received them, like the one with the rays destroys clouds that have been raised by a violent wind. O king!

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3302">‘Dhritarashtra said, “After speaking to Duryodhana, my son, who has always transgressed me, the preceptor was overcome by anger and penetrated the Pandavas. The brave one is extremely <a id="calibre_link-3303" class="calibre2"></a>skilled in weapons. He entered and roamed around in the battle. How did the Pandavas counter the great archer, Drona? Who protected the right wheel of the great-souled preceptor? When he killed the enemies in the battle, who protected his left wheel? The one who is supreme among all wielders of weapons seemed to be dancing along the path of his chariot.

Yudhishthira and Pandava Bhimasena also quickly attacked Drona, each with a separate army. So did the intelligent Nakula and the invincible Sahadeva. Dhrishtadyumna, Shatanika,<a id="calibre_link-2066" href="#calibre_link-1418" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">50</sup></a> Virata with the Kekayas, the Matsyas and the Shalveya soldiers also began to fight with Drona. O king! King Drupada, Dhrishtadyumna’s father, was protected by the Panchalas and advanced against Drona. The great archers, Droupadi’s sons, and the rakshasa Ghatotkacha also attacked the immensely illustrious Drona, with their soldiers. There were six thousand Prabhadrakas and Panchalas, skilled in striking. With Shikhandi at the forefront, they advanced against Drona. With other tigers among men, the maharatha Pandavas attacked Drona, bull among brahmanas. O bull among the Bharata lineage! When those brave ones advanced to fight, it was already night. It was fierce and increased the fear of cowards. O king! At that inauspicious and terrible time, many warriors went to their destruction. It caused the death of elephants, horses and elephants. During that terrible night, jackals howled in all directions. They caused great fear, because their gaping mouths were blazing. Fierce owls could be seen and they caused great terror. In particular, they were perched on the standards <a id="calibre_link-3305" class="calibre2"></a>of the Kouravas. O Indra among kings! A great roar arose among the soldiers. This mingled with the loud sound of battle drums and the blare of other drums, and with the trumpeting of elephants and the neighing of horses. There was the sound of hooves and a tumultuous noise spread everywhere. O great king! In that twilight hour, there was a fierce battle between Drona and all the Srinjayas. Darkness covered the earth and nothing could be seen. The dust raised by the soldiers covered everything. Men, horses and elephants were immersed in blood. The earth’s dust could no longer be seen and we were full of lassitude. During that night, a terrible slapping sound could be heard. It arose from the clashing of weapons and was like the noise of bamboos being burnt in a forest in the mountains. O king! Because everything was covered in darkness, one could not distinguish one’s own side from that of the enemy. At the beginning of that night, everyone seemed to be mad. O Indra among kings! The dust that arose from the earth settled down because of the blood. The darkness disappeared because of the golden radiance of armour and ornaments. O bull among the Bharata lineage! The army of the Bharatas was adorned with gems and gold and looked like the sky in the night, decorated with stars. Full of lances and standards, that place resounded with the noise of jackals and wild crows and fierce cries and roars made by those who were fighting. There was a great and tumultuous sound and it made the body hair stand up. All the directions were covered by the uproar, which was like the sound of the great Indra’s vajra. O great king! In that night, the soldiers of the Bharatas could be seen, illuminated with armlets, golden earrings and the radiance of weapons. There were elephants and chariots, decorated in gold. During that night, they looked like clouds tinged with lightning. Swords, lances, clubs, arrows, maces, javelins and battleaxes were seen to descend, flaming like fires. Duryodhana was like the wind at the front. The chariots and elephants were like clouds. The sound of musical instruments was like thunder. The bows and standards were like lightning. Drona and the Pandavas were like clouds. The swords, javelins and clubs were like thunder. The shower of arrows was like a terrible wind, both hot and cold. It was fierce <a id="calibre_link-3306" class="calibre2"></a>and caused extreme astonishment. It was destructive of life and there was no escape. Without any fear, the soldiers entered there, wishing to fight. At the beginning of that terrible night, there was a great roar that created fear among cowards and delighted heroes. An extremely terrible and fierce battle commenced in the night, as the Pandus and Srinjayas united and angrily attacked Drona. O king! But all those who advanced against the great-souled one were forced to retreat and some others were sent to Yama’s eternal abode.”’</p>

Who were the ones who remained behind the brave one and fought? Who fought in the front, as he killed the enemies in the battle? I think that all the Pandavas must have been afflicted with the arrows of Bharadvaja’s son. O lord! They must have been like lean cows trembling in the cold. Having penetrated the Panchalas, how did the great archer, tiger among men and destroyer of enemies, come by his death? All the soldiers and maharathas united and clashed in the night. They were agitated and crushed by him separately. Who were the intelligent ones who were present then?

On seeing the fierce and terrible state in the field of battle, the kings, your sons and Karna were distressed and fled in different directions. However, Drona’s son was proud of his strength of weapons and he alone was not distressed. He used his arrows to destroy the maya that had been created by Ghatotkacha.

The arrows were covered with blood and penetrated Sharadvati’s son.<a id="calibre_link-2088" href="#calibre_link-1440" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">72</sup></a> Those gold-tufted arrows, sharpened on stone, swiftly entered the ground. The powerful Ashvatthama, light in the use of his hands, became angry. He angrily pierced Ghatotkacha with ten arrows. Ghatotkacha was severely wounded in his inner organs by Drona’s son. He picked up a chakra with a hundred thousand spokes. Its edges were as sharp as a razor. It had the complexion of the rising sun and was decorated with gems and diamonds. Wishing to kill Ashvatthama, Bhimasena’s son hurled it. Though it descended with great force, Drona’s son used arrows to swiftly shatter it into fragments. It was foiled and fell down on the ground, like the wishes of an unfortunate person. On seeing that the chakra had been brought down, Ghatotkacha quickly enveloped Drona’s son with arrows, like Svarbhanu<a id="calibre_link-2089" href="#calibre_link-1441" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">73</sup></a> covering the sun.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3323">‘“Ghatotkacha’s son was handsome and was like a mass of collyrium. As Drona’s son advanced, he checked him, like a king of mountains against the wind. Anjanaparva, Bhimasena’s grandson, brought down a shower of arrows and he<a id="calibre_link-2090" href="#calibre_link-1442" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">74</sup></a> looked like Mount Meru, with rain from a cloud pouring down on it. Ashvatthama was like Rudra, Upendra<a id="calibre_link-2091" href="#calibre_link-1443" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">75</sup></a> and Indra in his valour and he was not frightened. He severed Anjanaparva’s standard with an arrow and cut down his two charioteers with two others. With three others, he severed the <em class="calibre4">trivenu</em>.<a id="calibre_link-2092" href="#calibre_link-1444" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">76</sup></a> He severed his bow with one and struck his four horses with four.

O king! The son of Hidimba’s son quickly grasped a golden club and whirling it, hurled it. However, Drona’s son struck it with his arrows and made it fall down. At this, Anjanaparva rose up into the sky and began to roar like a dark cloud. He showered down trees from the sky. Ghatotkacha’s son was versed in maya. But Drona’s son used arrows to strike him in the sky, like the rays of the sun against clouds. He then descended and once again stationed himself on his chariot, decorated with gold. Anjanaparva was as beautiful as a lofty mountain. He was clad in iron armour. But Drona’s son killed Anjanaparva, the son of Bhima’s son, like Maheshvara against Andhaka.</p>

Without any fear, he spoke these words to Sharadvati’s son, who was then consuming the army of the Pandavas, like a fire that has arisen in the forest. ‘O Drona’s son! Stay. You will not escape from me with your life. I will kill you today, like Agni’s son destroyed Krouncha.’<a id="calibre_link-2096" href="#calibre_link-1448" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">80</sup></a> Ashvatthama replied, ‘O child!

I have no desire to be angry with you. However, if anger is generated, one may end up killing one’s own self.’ Bhimasena’s son was overcome with sorrow on account of his son. On hearing these words, his eyes became coppery red with rage. He approached Ashvatthama and said, ‘O Drona’s son! Do you think that I am an ordinary person, who will be distressed in this battle? I have been born from Bhima, in the noble lineage of the Kurus. I am a son of the Pandavas and they never retreat from a battle. I am a lord of the rakshasas and I am Dashagriva’s<a id="calibre_link-2098" href="#calibre_link-1450" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">82</sup></a> equal in strength. O son of Drona! Wait. Wait.

On the field of the battle today, I will destroy your love for fighting.’ Having spoken these words, the extremely strong rakshasa, with eyes coppery red in rage, angrily attacked Drona’s son, like a lion against a king of elephants. Ghatotkacha showered down wheels of chariots and arrows, like a cloud showering rain. These descended on Drona’s son, bull among rathas. But before that shower of arrows could reach him, Drona’s son countered them with his arrows. It seemed that a battle was raging in the sky between those two sets of arrows. Because of the friction from those weapons, sparks of flame were generated and at the commencement of the night, the sky seemed to be bright with fireflies. Drona’s son, proud in battle, pacified and destroyed that maya. Seeing that his maya had been dispelled, Ghatotkacha disappeared again. He assumed the form of a lofty mountain, with trees crowding the summit. It had large fountains, from which, spears, javelins, swords and clubs flowed like water. Drona’s son saw that mountain, which was like a mass of collyrium. Large numbers of weapons issued from it. Drona’s son smiled and invoked the vajra weapon. Struck by that weapon, that king of mountains was quickly destroyed. He<a id="calibre_link-2099" href="#calibre_link-1451" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">83</sup></a> then became a blue cloud in the firmament, decorated with Indra’s weapon.<a id="calibre_link-2100" href="#calibre_link-1452" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">84</sup></a> He brought down a shower of boulders and covered Drona’s son in that battle. Drona’s son, supreme among those who have knowledge of weapons, then affixed the <em class="calibre4">vayavya</em> weapon and struck the blue cloud that had arisen. Drona’s son covered all the directions with his large numbers of arrows. The supreme of men killed a hundred thousand rathas. He then saw that Ghatotkacha was again fearlessly advancing towards him on a chariot, with his bow stretched, and surrounded by many rakshasas. They were like lions and tigers and like crazy elephants in their valour. They were on elephants and chariots and astride the backs of horses. Their mouths gaped. Their heads and necks were fierce. These were the followers of Hidimba’s son. There were Poulastyas and Yatudhanas.<a id="calibre_link-2101" href="#calibre_link-1453" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">85</sup></a> They were extremely terrible <a id="calibre_link-3327" class="calibre2"></a>in their valour. Those brave ones wielded many kinds of weapons and were clad in many kinds of armour and ornaments. They were immensely strong and made a fierce noise. Their eyes were dilated with rage. Those rakshasas, invincible in battle, arrived to fight.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3328">‘“On seeing them, your son was distressed and Drona’s son spoke to him. ‘O Duryodhana! Wait. You should not feel any fear now.

Assure your army.’ Duryodhana replied, ‘Since your mind is vast, I do not think that what you have said is wonderful. O descendant of the Goutama lineage! Your devotion to us is great.’ Having spoken these words to Ashvatthama, he then spoke to Soubala. ‘Dhananjaya is surrounded by a hundred thousand rathas, who are ornaments on the field of battle. Advance against Dhananjaya with sixty thousand elephants and Karna, Vrishasena, Kripa and Nila. The ones from the north, Kritavarma, Purumitra, Shrutaparna, Duhshasana, Nikumbha, Kundabhedi, Urukrama, Puranjaya, Dridharatha, Pataki, Hemapankaja, Shalya, Aruni, Indrasena, Sanjaya, Vijaya, Jaya, Kamalaksha, Puru, Krathi, Jayavarma and Sudarshana&mdash;these will follow you with sixty thousand foot soldiers. O maternal uncle! Slay Bhima, the twins and Dharmaraja, like Indra of the gods against the asuras. My hopes of victory are established in you. They have been severely struck by the arrows of Drona’s son and have been wounded in the battle. O maternal uncle!

Extremely angry, Ghatotkacha struck Goutami’s son in the chest with ten arrows that were as firm as poison or the fire. He was severely struck by those arrows shot by Bhima’s son and wavered on his chariot, like a tree struck by the wind. Ghatotkacha then used an anjalika arrow that was extremely radiant to quickly <a id="calibre_link-3330" class="calibre2"></a>sever the bow in the hand of Drona’s son. Drona’s son grasped another bow that was large and was capable of bearing a heavy burden. He showered down sharp arrows, like rain flowing down from a cloud. O descendant of the Bharata lineage!

Having consumed them for the sake of your welfare, Drona’s son, foremost among victorious ones, was resplendent. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! No one among the thousands of kings and the Pandavas was capable of glancing towards Drona’s son in that battle. The only exception was the brave Ghatotkacha, the immensely strong Indra among the rakshasas.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3331">‘“O foremost among the Bharata lineage! His eyes were red with rage. He slapped his palms against each other and bit his lower lips. He angrily addressed his own charioteer. ‘Take me to the son of Drona.’ He was borne on a chariot that was terrible in form and had a victorious flag fastened to it. The destroyer of enemies again engaged in a duel with Drona’s son. The rakshasa angrily hurled an extremely terrible vajra, made by Rudra, towards Drona’s son. It possessed eight wheels. Drona’s son abandoned his chariot and bow and leapt <a id="calibre_link-3332" class="calibre2"></a>down. He seized it,<a id="calibre_link-2107" href="#calibre_link-1459" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">91</sup></a> hurled it back and again ascended his chariot. Immensely radiant, it consumed his<a id="calibre_link-2108" href="#calibre_link-1460" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">92</sup></a> horses, charioteer, standard and mounts. Having done this, the extremely terrible vajra penetrated the earth. On witnessing that deed of Drona’s son, where he had leapt down and seized the extremely terrible weapon made by Shankara, all the beings worshipped him. O king! Going to Dhrishtadyumna’s chariot, Bhimasena’s son again released sharp arrows towards the broad chest of Drona’s son. Without any fear, Dhrishtadyumna also shot gold-tufted arrows that were like venomous serpents towards the chest of Drona’s son. Drona’s son shot thousands of iron arrows at them. However, those two lions among men used their own arrows, which were like flames of fire, to counter them. O bull among the Bharata lineage! That extremely fierce battle delighted all warriors. With a thousand chariots, three hundred elephants and six thousand horses, Bhima arrived at that spot.</p>

While Bhimasena, Hidimba’s son, Parshata, the twin warriors, Dharma’s son, Vijaya and Achyuta looked on, within an instant, he used sharp arrows to destroy one akshouhini of rakshasas, with their horses, charioteers, chariots and elephants.

Standards were strewn around like frogs and drums were <a id="calibre_link-3334" class="calibre2"></a>scattered like tortoises. The umbrellas were like arrays of swans. The garlands and whisks were like foam. Herons and vultures were giant crocodiles. The many weapons were the fish. Chariots that were hurled away were like giant banks. The beautiful flags were the trees. The extremely terrible arrows were the smaller fish. The lances and spears were the fierce lizards. The marrow and flesh constituted the large mire. Headless torsos were the rafts. The hair was the moss and it increased terror among those who were cowards. The horse riders were giant serpents and there was an inexhaustible flow of bodies. There was an immensely forceful river of blood that was created by Drona’s son. Warriors lamented in loud tones. The wounds<a id="calibre_link-2110" href="#calibre_link-1462" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">94</sup></a> were the waves.

He killed ten of Kuntibhoja’s sons with ten arrows. Ashvatthama was extremely angry. He affixed a supreme arrow and drawing his bow back all the way up to his ear, released that supreme arrow, which was terrible and like Yama’s staff. He quickly shot it towards Ghatotkacha. O lord of the earth! That great and well-tufted arrow pierced the rakshasa’s heart and swiftly penetrated the earth. On seeing him fall, maharatha Dhrishtadyumna thought that he had been killed.

On beholding Satyaki in that battle, Somadatta again became angry and enveloped him in every direction with a great shower of arrows. There was an extremely terrible battle between those on your side and the enemy and it increased fear. It was fierce and was fought by those who desired victory. For the sake of Satvata, Bhima pierced Kourava Somadatta with ten arrows and the brave one pierced him back with one hundred.

For the sake of Satvata, in the forefront of that battle, Bhima afflicted and pierced the great-souled Bahlika with nine arrows. Pratipa’s son was enraged. The mighty-armed one struck Bhima on the chest with a lance, like Purandara hurling the vajra. Having been struck by it, Bhima trembled and lost his senses. Having recovered his senses, the powerful one hurled an iron club. Thus struck by Pandava, Bahlika’s head was severed.

O one who grants honours! Once that great archer has been slain, his brothers will come under your control and will again be exiled to the forest. O Kouravya! As long as I am alive, you should never sorrow. I will defeat all the Pandavas in the battle, together with the Panchalas, the Kekayas and the assembled Vrishnis. I will use torrents of arrows to make them porcupines and give the earth to you.’”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3349">‘Sanjaya said, “When Karna said this, the mighty-armed Kripa Sharadvata smiled and spoke these words to the son of the suta. ‘O Karna! Wonderful. This is wonderful. The bull among the Kuru lineage has a protector. O Radheya! With you as a protector, if only words could bring success. O Karna! In Kouravya’s presence, you speak a lot. But one rarely witnesses your valour or your strength. We have seen you in many encounters with the son of Pandu. O son of a suta! You have always been defeated by Pandava. O Karna! When the son of Dhritarashtra was being taken away by the gandharvas, all the soldiers fought. You were the sole exception and you ran away.<a id="calibre_link-2132" href="#calibre_link-1484" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">116</sup></a> O Karna!

How can you have the enterprise to defeat all the Pandavas, <a id="calibre_link-3350" class="calibre2"></a>together with Krishna? O Karna! O son of a suta! You have spoken a lot about fighting. Do not speak and show your valour now. That is the vow which virtuous men follow. O son of a suta! You are always thundering, like clouds in the autumn, which do not have any water. O Karna! You are seen to be without success. But the king does not understand this. O Radheya! You will roar as long as you do not see Partha. When you see Partha in front of you, your roars will become rare. You will roar as long as you are beyond the reach of Phalguna’s arrows. Once you are pierced by Partha’s arrows, your roars will be rare. Kshatriyas show their valour through their arms. Brahmanas show their valour through their eloquence with words. Phalguna’s bravery is in his bow. Karna’s bravery is in his fancies.’</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3351">‘“When Sharadvata addressed these harsh words to him, Karna, supreme among strikers, spoke these words to Kripa. ‘Brave ones always roar, like clouds that shower down rain. Once seeds have been sown in the soil, the fruits are soon obtained. I do not see any faults in brave ones who are in the vanguard of the battle and having taken up heavy burdens, indulge in boasting. When a man bears a burden, it is also established in his mind. It is certain that destiny also aids him then. In my mind, I have resolved to take up an extremely heavy and unmatched burden. O brahmana! If I decide to thunder then, how does it harm you in any way? Like clouds that are full of water, brave ones do not roar in vain. Knowing their own capacity, the Pandavas are roaring. I will make endeavours in the battle today, against the united Krishna and Pandava. O Goutama! I am thundering because of the initiative that has been generated. O brahmana! With your followers, behold the fruits of that roaring. I will kill the sons of Pandu, together with Krishna and the Satvatas. I will give Duryodhana the earth, bereft of all thorns.’</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3352">‘“Kripa replied, ‘O son of a suta! These fancies are delusions and I do not accept them.

Yudhishthira, Dharma’s son, is devoted to brahmanas. He is truthful in speech and self-controlled. He worships his seniors and the gods. He is always devoted to dharma. In particular, he is skilled in the use of weapons. He is intelligent and grateful. His brothers are strong and have practised the use of all weapons. They are devoted to serving their superiors. They are wise, always devoted to dharma and illustrious. Their relatives have Indra’s valour. They are skilled in striking and are devoted to them.

When these are on their side, they cannot be destroyed. If they so desire, the entire universe, with gods, asuras and men, with the yakshas, masses of rakshasas, beings, serpents and elephants can be destroyed through the valour of the weapons of Bhima and Phalguna. Yudhishthira can consume the earth with his sight. The armoured Shouri is engaged in their cause and his strength is immeasurable. O Karna! How can you contemplate vanquishing the enemy in a battle? O son of a suta! You have always been extremely stupid, since you are thinking of engaging with Shouri in the battle.’”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3354">‘Sanjaya said, “O bull among the Bharata lineage! Thus addressed, Radheya laughed. Karna spoke these words to the preceptor, Kripa Sharadvata. ‘O brahmana! The words that you have spoken about the Pandavas are indeed true. That apart, there are many other qualities vested in Pandu’s son. Partha cannot be vanquished in battle, even by the gods, with Vasava, and by the daityas, yakshas, gandharvas, pishachas, serpents and rakshasas. But even then, I can defeat Partha because of the spear that has been given to me by Vasava. O brahmana! The spear that Shakra has given me is incapable of being <a id="calibre_link-3355" class="calibre2"></a>repulsed. In the battle, I will kill Savyasachi with this. Once Pandava has been killed, Krishna and his brothers will never be able to enjoy the earth, since Arjuna won’t be there. All of them will be destroyed. O Goutama! Without making any efforts, the earth, with all its oceans, will come under Kourava’s suzerainty. There is no doubt that good policies can ensure success in everything. O Goutama! I am roaring because I know all this. You are a brahmana and are aged. You are incapable in battle. You are deluded by affection towards Partha and are insulting me. O brahmana! O evil-minded one! If you again speak such injurious words to me, I will take out my sword and slice off your tongue. O brahmana! You wish to praise the Pandavas in this encounter, in order to frighten all the soldiers and the Kouravas. O brahmana! Listen to the words I have to say on this. Duryodhana, Drona, Shakuni, Durmukha, Jaya, Duhshasana, Vrishasena, the king of Madra, you, Somadatta, Bhuri,<a id="calibre_link-2136" href="#calibre_link-1488" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">120</sup></a> Drona’s son and Vivimshati have stationed themselves in this battle.

In a battle, they can kill even the gods. They are stationed in this battle, wishing to kill the Pandavas. These armoured ones wish for Kouraveya’s victory. Even for extremely powerful ones, I think that victory depends on destiny, since the mighty-armed Bhishma is lying down, having been pierced by a hundred arrows. Vikarna, Chitrasena, Bahlika, Jayadratha, Bhurishrava, Jaya, Jalasandha, Sudakshina, Shala, best among rathas, the valiant Bhagadatta and many other brave kings, who were extremely difficult even for the gods to vanquish, have been killed in this battle, though they were stronger than the Pandavas. O worst of men! Do you not think that this is nothing but destiny? O brahmana! You have always sought to satisfy Duryodhana’s enemies. Even among them, hundreds and thousands of brave ones have been killed. All the soldiers, of both the Kurus and the Pandavas, have been destroyed. I do not see any power on the part of the Pandavas. O worst of brahmana<em class="calibre4">s</em>! You have always thought them to be strong. I will fight against them in this battle, to <a id="calibre_link-3356" class="calibre2"></a>the best of my capacity, for the sake of ensuring Duryodhana’s welfare.

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3358">‘Sanjaya said, “On seeing that the son of the suta had addressed harsh words towards his maternal uncle,<a id="calibre_link-2137" href="#calibre_link-1489" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">121</sup></a> Drona’s son powerfully raised his sword and rushed against him. Ashvatthama said, ‘O Karna! O extremely evil-minded one! O worst of men! O one with wicked intelligence! Behold. I will use this sword to sever your head from your body.’ O great king! On seeing him forcefully attack, King Duryodhana himself and Kripa, foremost among men, restrained him. Karna said, ‘O supreme among Kurus! This worst of brahmanas<a id="calibre_link-2138" href="#calibre_link-1490" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">122</sup></a> is evil-minded. He brags about his bravery in battle. Set him free and let him have a taste of my valour.’ Ashvatthama replied, ‘O son of a suta! O extremely evil-minded one! This transgression of yours will be pardoned by us. But this increasing insolence of yours will be destroyed by Phalguna.’ Duryodhana said, ‘O Ashvatthama! O one who grants honours! Be pacified. You should pardon him. You should never be angry with the son of the suta. You, Karna, Kripa, Drona, the king of Madra and Soubala have to undertake a great task. O supreme among brahmanas! Be pacified. All the Pandavas are advancing in this direction, wishing to fight with Radheya. O brahmana! They are attacking in every direction.’ The valiant Karna, foremost among rathas, raised the best of bows. He was surrounded by the foremost of the Kouravas, like Shakra by masses of gods. Resorting to the strength of his own arms, the energetic one remained stationed there.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3359">‘“O great king! A battle then commenced between Karna and the Pandavas. They angrily rushed at each other, roaring like lions. On <a id="calibre_link-3360" class="calibre2"></a>seeing the mighty-armed Karna, in that great battle, they<a id="calibre_link-2139" href="#calibre_link-1491" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">123</sup></a> let out a roar. ‘There is Karna. Where is Karna stationed? Karna, wait. O evil-souled one! O worst of men! Fight with us.’ Others saw Karna and their eyes became red with anger. They said, ‘This son of a suta is limited in his intelligence. He deserves to be killed by all these lions among kings. No purpose is served by his remaining alive. He shows extreme enmity towards the Parthas. This man has always been wicked. He bases himself on Duryodhana’s advice and is the root of all injury. Let us kill him.’ Thus conversing, the kshatriyas attacked. Goaded by the Pandaveyas, to kill the son of the suta, the maharathas enveloped him with a great shower of arrows. On seeing all those maharathas advancing towards him, the son of the suta was not distressed. He was not overcome by fear. He saw that advancing ocean of soldiers, like a city. He was powerful and undefeated in battle. O bull among the Bharata lineage! For the sake of your sons, the extremely powerful one, swift in the use of his hands, released a shower of arrows and countered those soldiers in every direction. The kings also showered down arrows on him. They brandished hundreds and thousands of bows. They fought against Radheya, like masses of daityas against Shakra. In every direction, the lord Karna used his great shower of arrows to counter the shower of arrows that were released by the kings. As they sought to counter each other’s deeds, it was extraordinary, like Shakra against the danavas, in the battle between the gods and the asuras. We witnessed the extraordinary dexterity shown by the son of the suta then. Though they strove in the battle, the enemy could not strike him. He repulsed the storm of arrows released by the maharatha kings. With sharp arrows that were marked with his own name, Radheya pierced yokes, umbrellas, standards and horses. Oppressed by Karna, the kings became anxious. At that time, they were like cows afflicted by the cold. Horses, elephants and rathas were slain. We saw that large numbers of them were brought down by Karna. O king! Heads and arms were strewn around in every direction. The earth was strewn with brave ones who did not retreat. <a id="calibre_link-3361" class="calibre2"></a>They were killed and were being killed. There were lamentations everywhere. With all those fierce warriors, the place looked like Vaivasvata’s<a id="calibre_link-2140" href="#calibre_link-1492" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">124</sup></a> city.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3362">‘“On witnessing Karna’s valour, King Duryodhana approached Ashvatthama and spoke these words. ‘In this battle, the armoured Karna is fighting with all the kings. Behold. Afflicted by Karna’s arrows, the soldiers are running away. They are like an army of the asuras, being driven away by Kartikeya. In this encounter, the soldiers can be seen to have been defeated by the intelligent Karna. Look. Bibhatsu is advancing, wishing to kill the son of the suta. Therefore, take appropriate steps, so that the maharatha son of a suta is not killed by Pandava in the battle.’ At this, Drona’s son, Kripa, Shalya and maharatha Hardikya advanced against Partha, with a view to rescuing the son of a suta. On seeing that they were advancing, Kounteya advanced against Karna, like the gods and the powerful Shakra against Vritra.”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3363">‘Dhritarashtra asked, “O suta! On seeing the angry Phalguna advance, like Death, what did Vaikartana Karna do next? The maharatha has always sought to rival Partha. In an encounter, he was confident that he would defeat the extremely fierce Bibhatsu. He now suddenly obtained someone towards whom he has always borne extreme enmity. O suta! What did Vaikartana Karna do next?”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3364">‘Sanjaya replied, “Pandava was advancing, like an elephant against another elephant. On seeing this, Karna fearlessly advanced against Dhananjaya. When Vaikartana’s arrows descended with force, the energetic Pandava, the scorcher of enemies, countered them. O venerable one! Karna enveloped him with a net of arrows. Extremely angry, he pierced him with his arrows. The immensely strong Partha could not tolerate his dexterity. The scorcher of enemies released thirty arrows towards the son of a suta. These arrows were sharp, pointed at the tip, and sharpened on stone. Extremely enraged, the powerful and valiant one pierced him on the forefront of his left arm with another arrow and seemed to be laughing. Having been pierced with great force, the bow fell down from his hand. But in <a id="calibre_link-3365" class="calibre2"></a>an instant, the immensely strong one<a id="calibre_link-2141" href="#calibre_link-1493" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">125</sup></a> picked up another bow and displaying the lightness of his hands, shrouded Phalguna with a storm of arrows. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! The son of a suta released a shower of arrows. Dhananjaya smiled and countered that shower of arrows. O king! They showered down arrows at each other. Those great archers enveloped each other, wishing to outdo each other’s deeds. In that battle, there was a wonderful encounter between Karna and Pandava. They were angry, like wild elephants driven by desire.<a id="calibre_link-2142" href="#calibre_link-1494" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">126</sup></a> On beholding Karna’s prowess, Partha, the great archer, quickly severed the bow from his hand. With four broad-headed arrows, he dispatched his horses to Yama’s abode. The scorcher of enemies severed his charioteer’s head from his body. His bow was severed. His horses were slain. His charioteer was killed. Partha, Pandu’s descendant, pierced him with four arrows. With his horses slain, that bull among men swiftly got down from his chariot. Afflicted by those arrows, he quickly climbed onto Kripa’s chariot.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3366">‘“O bull among the Bharata lineage! On seeing that Radheya had been defeated and afflicted by Dhananjaya’s arrows, those on your side fled in the ten directions. O king! On seeing that they were running away, King Duryodhana restrained them and spoke these words to them. ‘O brave ones! Do not run away. O bulls among the kshatriyas! Stay here. To kill Partha in this battle, I will myself advance. I will kill Partha, together with the Panchalas and the Somakas. Today, I will fight with the wielder of Gandiva. Partha will witness my valour, which is like Death at the end of a yuga. I will release thousands of nets of arrows. The warriors will see them in the battle, descending like locusts. I will shower down arrows from my bow, like from clouds at the end of summer. The warriors and the soldiers will see them. With my straight-tufted arrows, I will vanquish Partha in the battle today. O brave ones! Stay in this battle and give up your fear of Phalguna. Phalguna will not be able to withstand my valour today. I will be like the shoreline, holding back the ocean that is the abode of makaras.’ Having said this, surrounded by a large <a id="calibre_link-3367" class="calibre2"></a>army of soldiers, the king advanced towards the invincible Phalguna. His eyes were red with rage.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3368">‘“On seeing that the mighty-armed one was advancing, Sharadvata approached Ashvatthama and spoke these words to him. ‘This mighty-armed king is intolerant and has lost his senses because of his rage.

While we look on, he will give up his life before Partha. As long as he is not within the reach of Phalguna’s arrows, the Kourava king will be alive. O brave one! Quickly restrain him. Partha’s terrible arrows are like snakes that have cast off their skins. Restrain him in this battle, before the king is reduced to ashes. O granter of honours! While we are here and are looking on, he should not engage himself. As long as his aides are here, the king should not fight with Partha himself. If Kouravya fights with Partha Kiriti, I think it will be difficult for him to remain alive, like an elephant against a tiger.’ Having been addressed by his maternal uncle, Drona’s son, supreme among the wielders of weapons, quickly went to Duryodhana and spoke these words. ‘O Gandhari’s son! As long as I am live, you should not fight. O Kouravya! I have always desired your welfare and you are disregarding me. You should not have any anxiety about defeating Partha. O Suyodhana! I will restrain him. You stay here.’</p>

O supreme among brahmanas! You have also always been partial towards them. It is my misfortune that your valour in battle has always been mild. Perhaps it is because of your affection towards Dharmaraja or Droupadi. I do not know. I am ashamed because of my own avarice. All the relatives deserved happiness. But they confronted supreme unhappiness and have been defeated. You are foremost among wielders of weapons. You are Maheshvara’s equal in battle. O son of Goutami! Had you so wished, you were capable of destroying my enemies. O Ashvatthama! Show me your favours. Destroy those who are causing me injury. O unblemished one! Even the gods are incapable of remaining within <a id="calibre_link-3370" class="calibre2"></a>reach of your weapons. O Drona’s son! Kill the Panchalas and the Somakas, with their followers, in the battle. Protected by you, we will kill the ones who remain. O brahmana! These Somakas and illustrious Panchalas are angrily roaming around amidst my soldiers, like a conflagaration. O mighty-armed one! O supreme among men! Restrain them and the Kekayas. Otherwise, protected by Kiriti, they will destroy us before that. O venerable one! This is your task, regardless of whether you do it now or later. O mighty-armed one! You have been born for the destruction of the Panchalas. O one without decay! You will make the world empty of all the Panchalas. The sages who obtained success spoke about the future in this way. The gods, together with Vasava, are incapable of remaining within reach of your weapons, not to speak of the Parthas and the Panchalas. I am telling you this truthfully.’”’</p>

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3372">‘Sanjaya said, “Drona’s son was invincible in a battle. Thus addressed by Duryodhana, the mighty-armed one replied, ‘O Kourava! What you have said is true. The Pandavas have always been dear to me and my father. And we are also dear to them. O extender of the Kuru lineage! But that does not apply to a battle. O son!<a id="calibre_link-2145" href="#calibre_link-1497" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">129</sup></a> We will fight to the best of our capacity and without any fear, are prepared to give up our lives in battle.

O descendant of the Bharata lineage! <a id="calibre_link-3373" class="calibre2"></a>Energy has clashed against energy and is being pacified. As long as Pandu’s son<a id="calibre_link-2147" href="#calibre_link-1499" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">131</sup></a> is alive, the Pandava army is incapable of being quickly defeated. I tell you this truthfully. The sons of Pandu are capable and are fighting for their own interests. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! Why should they not be able to slaughter your soldiers? O king! You are extremely avaricious. O Kourava! You have resorted to deceit. You are insolent and are suspicious of everything. That is the reason you suspect those on your own side. For your sake, I am making the best of efforts and am prepared to give up my own life. O descendant of the Kuru lineage! For your sake, I will advance to fight. I will fight against the enemy and defeat the best of the best. O destroyer of enemies! To bring you pleasure in this battle, I will fight with the Panchalas, Somakas, Kekayas and Pandaveyas. The Panchalas and Somakas will be consumed by my arrows. They will be like cattle afflicted by a lion and will run away in different directions. The king who is Dharma’s son will witness my valour today. Against the Somakas, the world will be full of Ashvatthama, and Yudhishthira, Dharma’s son, will be severely distressed. In the battle, he will see that the Panchalas and the Somakas have been killed. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! I will kill whoever advances to do battle with me. O brave one! Having encountered me, no one will be able to escape with his life.’ Having spoken thus to your son, Duryodhana, the mighty-armed one advanced to fight and to drive away all the archers. The supreme of all beings wished to do that which would bring pleasure to your sons.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3374">‘“Goutami’s son then spoke to the Kekayas and the Panchalas. ‘O maharathas! All of you strike at my body. Remain stationed in this battle and show me the dexterity of your weapons.’ O great king! Thus addressed, all of them showered down weapons towards Drona’s son, like water pouring down from the clouds. Having destroyed those arrows, Drona’s son brought down eight heroes, in front of the sons of Pandu and the lord Dhrishtadyumna. In that battle, the Panchalas and Srinjayas were killed and abandoning the fight with Drona’s son, fled in the ten directions.</p>
<a id="calibre_link-3375" class="calibre2"></a>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3376">‘“O great king! On seeing that the brave Panchalas and Somakas were running away in that battle, Dhrishtadyumna attacked Drona’s son. He was surrounded by one hundred brave rathas who did not retreat. They were on golden and colourful chariots that roared, like clouds full of rain. On seeing that warriors had been brought down, maharatha Dhrishtadyumna, the son of the king of Panchala, spoke these words to Drona’s son. ‘O son of the preceptor! O evil-minded one! Why are you killing these? If you are brave in a battle, fight against me. If you are stationed in front of me, I will kill you.’ O bull among the Bharata lineage! The powerful Dhrishtadyumna pierced the son of the preceptor with sharp arrows that penetrated the inner organs. Drona’s son was struck by a continuous line of swift arrows. They were gold-tufted, pointed at the tip, fierce and capable of piercing all bodies. He looked like a flowering tree, with bees in search of honey hovering around it. Thus pierced, he became extremely angry, like a snake that has been struck with a foot. Drona’s proud son was not frightened. With the bow in his hand, he spoke these words. ‘O Dhrishtadyumna! Wait for an instant, without going away. I will shoot sharp arrows and send you to Yama’s abode.’ Saying this, Drona’s son, the destroyer of enemy heroes, showed the dexterity of his hands and enveloped Parshata in every direction with a torrent of arrows. The one who was invincible in battle was thus shrouded in that encounter by Drona’s son. The eloquent son of Panchala roared and spoke to Drona’s son. ‘O brahmana! You do not know about my origin or my vow. O extremely evil-minded one! I will not kill you, without killing Drona first. In this battle today, I will kill your father, and then you. I will convey you to the world of the dead. That is my resolution. You have hatred towards the Parthas and are devoted to the Kouravas. As long as I see you stationed before me, you will not escape with your life. As for that brahmana,<a id="calibre_link-2148" href="#calibre_link-1500" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">132</sup></a> he has abandoned the conduct of brahmanas and is devoted to the dharma of kshatriyas. That wicked of men should be slain by all the worlds, just as you should be.’ Having been thus harshly addressed by Parshata, the supreme among brahmanas was <a id="calibre_link-3377" class="calibre2"></a>overcome by great rage and asked him to wait. He glanced at Parshata and seemed to burn him down with his eyes.</p>

In that battle, he was enveloped by Drona’s son, though that supreme among rathas was surrounded by all the Panchala soldiers. However, the mighty-armed one did not tremble and resorting to his own fortitude, shot many kinds of arrows at Ashvatthama. In that battle, they countered each other, as if they were in a gambling match in which their lives were the stakes. They could not tolerate each other and countered those torrents of arrows. The great archers created showers of arrows in every direction. The clash between Drona’s son and Parshata was terrible in form and fierce. On beholding this, the siddhas and charanas worshipped them. The torrents of arrows filled the sky and the directions and as they fought, they created a great darkness with those arrows, so that they could not be seen. They seemed to be dancing around in that encounter, with the bows drawn in circles. They sought to kill each other and wished to defeat each other. Those mighty-armed ones fought wonderfully, showing their dexterity and skills. In that encounter, thousands of foremost among warriors applauded them. They were seen to fight in that battle, like wild elephants in the forest. Both the armies were filled with great delight. O venerable one! Roars like lions’ were heard and conch shells were blown. The fierce battle increased the terror of cowards. For a short instant, that tumultuous battle seemed to be equal. O great king! Then Drona’s son severed the standard, bow, the umbrella, the two parshni charioteers, the charioteer and the four horses of great-souled Parshata. He killed them in the battle and brought them down on the ground. The one with an immeasurable soul then used straight-tufted arrows to drive away hundreds and thousands of Panchalas. O bull among the Bharata lineage! The Pandava soldiers were distressed on seeing the great deeds, which were like those of Vasava, of Drona’s son in the battle. He killed a hundred maharatha Panchalas with a hundred arrows. With three sharp arrows, Drona’s son killed three other maharathas, while Drupada’s son<a id="calibre_link-2149" href="#calibre_link-1501" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">133</sup></a> and Phalguna looked on. <a id="calibre_link-3379" class="calibre2"></a>He killed many Panchalas who were stationed before him. In that encounter, the Panchalas and the Srinjayas were slaughtered. Their chariots and standards were strewn around. They dared not approach Drona’s son and abandoned him. Thus did Drona’s maharatha son defeat the enemies in that battle. He let out a mighty roar, like clouds at the end of summer. Having killed many brave ones, Ashvatthama was resplendent. He was like the fire that consumes all beings at the end of a yuga. Having defeated thousands of enemies in the battle, he was honoured by the Kouraveyas. Drona’s powerful son was resplendent, like Indra of the gods, after having killed large numbers of the enemy.”’</p>

King Duryodhana and Bharadvaja’s son attacked the Pandavas in that encounter and a battle commenced. O great king! It was terrible in form and increased the terror of cowards. Yudhishthira was angry and dispatched large numbers of Ambashthas, Malavas, Vangas, Shibis and Trigartas to the world of the dead. Bhima was indomitable in battle. He killed Abhisahas, Shurasenas and other kshatriyas and filled the earth with the mire of blood. O king! In that battle, Kiriti used sharp arrows to send large numbers of Youdheyas, those from the mountainous regions and Madrakas to the world of the dead. They were severely afflicted with iron arrows.

Slice down.’ These and other fierce sounds were heard in the vicinity of the chariot of the one with the red horses.<a id="calibre_link-2151" href="#calibre_link-1503" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">135</sup></a> Drona became extremely angry and used the vayavya weapon in the battle. He was unapproachable and killed them, like a turbulent wind driving away clouds. While Bhimasena and the great-souled Partha looked on, the Panchalas were slaughtered by Drona and fled. But Kiriti and Bhima forcefully restrained them. They attacked your army with a large number of chariots. Bibhatsu was on the right flank and Vrikodara on the left. They showered down great torrents of arrows on Bharadvaja’s son. O great king! Maharatha Srinjayas, Panchalas, Matsyas and Somakas followed them. There were the best of rathas in the army of your son, skilled in striking. With a large army, they approached Drona’s chariot. That large army of the Bharatas was slaughtered by Kiriti. On top of this, they were afflicted by darkness and sleep. O great king! Though Drona himself and your son tried to restrain them, they were incapable of restraining the warriors. That large army was shattered by the arrows of Pandu’s son. With the world covered in darkness, they fled in all the directions. Some kings abandoned hundreds of their mounts. O great king! They were overcome by fear and ran away in different directions.”’</p>

Without killing the enemy, Bahlika’s son and the worst of the Kouravas, in the battle today, I will not return from the encounter. O suta! I tell you this truthfully.’ Thus addressed, the charioteer urged those extremely fast horses from the Saindhava region. They possessed <a id="calibre_link-3385" class="calibre2"></a>the complexion of conch shells and were capable of withstanding all sounds in the battle. They were as fast as thought or the wind and bore Yuyudhana. O king! They were like Indra’s tawny steeds in earlier times, when he ventured to kill the daityas. On seeing that Satvata was powerfully descending in the encounter, the mighty-armed Somadatta was not frightened and attacked him. He released showers of arrows, like clouds showering down rain. He shrouded Shini’s descendant, like clouds covering the sun. O bull among the Bharata lineage! Satyaki was also not frightened in that battle. In every direction, he enveloped the bull among the Kuru lineage with a torrent of arrows. Somadatta pierced Madhava in the chest with sixty arrows. O king! Satyaki pierced him back with sharp arrows. Wounded by each other’s arrows, those bulls among men looked resplendent. They were like blossoming kimshuka trees with beautiful blossoms at the time of flowering. The limbs of the illustrious ones from the Kuru and Vrishni lineages were covered with blood. They glanced at each other and seemed to burn each other down with their sight. Those scorchers of enemies roamed around in chariots that traversed circular paths. They were terrible in form and were like clouds that showered down rain. O Indra among kings! With arrows mangling their bodies everywhere and wounded by those arrows, they looked like porcupines. Those arrows were well tufted and struck by these, they were beautiful. O king! They looked like trees during the monsoon, covered by fireflies. The limbs of the maharathas blazed with those arrows. In that battle, they looked like angry elephants, covered with flaming torches.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3386">‘“O great king! In that encounter, maharatha Somadatta used an arrow in the shape of a half-moon to slice down Madhava’s great bow. He then swiftly struck him with twenty five arrows. At a time when speed was of the essence, he again struck him with ten arrows. Satyaki took up another bow that was more powerful. He quickly pierced Somadatta with five arrows. O king! In that encounter, Satyaki seemed to smile. He used another broad-headed arrow to cut down the golden standard of Bahlika’s son. On seeing that his standard had been brought down, Somadatta wasn’t scared. He struck Shini’s descendant with twenty-five arrows. Satvata became <a id="calibre_link-3387" class="calibre2"></a>enraged in that battle. In that encounter, he used a sharp kshurapra arrow to slice down the archer Somadatta’s bow. O king! He<a id="calibre_link-2152" href="#calibre_link-1504" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">136</sup></a> was like an elephant with its tusks shattered and he struck him in many ways with a hundred gold-tufted arrows that flew straight. Maharatha Somadatta took up another bow. The immensely strong one enveloped Satyaki with a shower of arrows. Extremely wrathful, Satyaki pierced Somadatta in that battle. Somadatta also afflicted Satyaki with his net of arrows.</p>

For Satvata’s sake, Bhimasena took up a new, firm and terrible club and hurled it towards Somadatta’s chest. On seeing that the club, terrible in form, was descending towards him in the battle, Kourava laughed and sliced it down into two fragments. That large and iron club was seen to be shattered into two fragments and fell down, like the giant summit of a mountain that has been shattered by thunder. O king! In that encounter, Satyaki used a broad-headed arrow to slice down Somadatta’s bow and used five more to cut down his arm-guards. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! He quickly struck his four supreme horses with four arrows and sent them to the king of the dead. With a broad-headed arrow with drooping tufts, he severed the charioteer’s head from his body. The tiger among rathas, the bull among the Shini lineage, laughed. O king! Satvata then released an extremely terrible arrow that flamed like the fire. It was gold-tufted and had been sharpened on stone. With great force, Shini’s descendant shot that supreme of arrows. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! That terrible arrow quickly struck the lord and brought him down. Severely wounded by the powerful maharatha Satvata, the mighty-armed Somadatta fell down and died.</p>

While Bharadvaja’s son looked on, Yudhishthira drove them away <a id="calibre_link-3390" class="calibre2"></a>with arrows. On seeing that the soldiers were being driven away by Yudhishthira, Drona attacked with great force. His eyes were red with rage. He pierced Partha with seven extremely sharp arrows. Having pierced him, the mighty-armed one licked the corners of his mouth and severed Yudhishthira’s standard and bow. In that encounter, with his bow severed, and at a time when speed was of the essence, the supreme among kings swiftly took up another firm bow. The king pierced Drona with a thousand arrows and his horses, charioteer, standard and chariot too. It was wonderful. O supreme among the Bharata lineage! For a short while, Drona was distressed and oppressed by that storm of arrows. He sank down on the floor of his chariot. However, in a short while, the supreme of brahmanas regained his senses. He was overcome by great rage and invoked the vayavya weapon. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! However, the valiant Partha was not frightened in the battle and stretched his bow, repulsing that weapon with a weapon of his own.</p>

Abandon the preceptor and go to the spot where King Suyodhana is. Bhima, tiger among rathas, is fighting with the Kouravas there.’ Having heard Vasudeva’s words, Dharmaraja Yudhishthira thought for an instant. He then went to the spot where Bhima, the destroyer of enemies, was stationed and was fighting a fierce battle. He was slaying your warriors, like Death with a gaping mouth. Pandava<a id="calibre_link-2154" href="#calibre_link-1506" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">138</sup></a> made the earth resound with the great clatter of his chariot.

As they were stationed in that encounter, the warriors could not see each other. The great battle continued on the basis of guessing and signs. Men, elephants and horses encountered supreme destruction and it made the body hair stand up. O supreme among kings! The brave Drona, Karna and Kripa and Bhima, Parshata and Satyaki, agitated each other’s soldiers. In every direction, the maharathas slaughtered the soldiers. Because of the darkness and the dust, the elephants fled in different directions. The warriors were terrified and bereft of their senses. They also fled in different directions. O great king! They were killed and fled in that encounter. Thousands of maharathas killed each other in that battle. They were blind and confounded by the darkness and this was due to your stupid son’s policy. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! All the soldiers, and the protectors of the soldiers, were confused in that battle. Everything was covered in darkness.”</p>

Divided through different standards, during that night, the army was beautiful because of the radiance of the fire. They were adorned in extremely expensive ornaments. They possessed divine weapons. These blazed as they were hurled. In a short while, properly arranged, those lamps lit up the entire army. The foot soldiers held lamps with oil in their hands and this made all the soldiers look radiant. They looked like clouds in the night sky, illuminated by lightning. When the soldiers were illuminated in this way, Drona, who was like the fire, scorched all the directions. O Indra among kings! In his golden armour, he was like the midday sun with its rays. As the light was reflected from golden ornaments, sparkling swords and bows and yellow weapons, it was beautiful. There were bright clubs and dazzling bludgeons. There were lances and spears. O Ajamidha! As they were repeatedly lit, the rays of the lamps reflected from these. O king! There were umbrellas, new whisks and other accompaniments and they flamed like giant meteors. There were golden garlands that were whirled around. They looked brilliant. Because of the reflection from the weapons and the illumination from the lamps, your army then looked dazzling. O king! There was the radiance from the reflection on ornaments and it was extremely beautiful. There were yellow weapons that were well crafted, used for mangling bodies. They were whirled by the brave ones and created a flaming radiance there, like the lightning in the sky at the end of summer. These were brought down with great force to kill the enemy and the faces of the men trembled as they did this, like large clouds driven by the wind. It was as if a raging conflagaration blazes like the sun and destroys a large forest. O descendant of the Bharata lineage!

There were others along the flanks of all the soldiers, at the rear and in the front, in every direction. Other men roamed around in the midst of the two armies, with flaming torches <a id="calibre_link-3399" class="calibre2"></a>in their hands. All the soldiers and the masses of infantry got mixed up with the elephants, the chariots and the large numbers of horses. The army of the sons of Pandu was illuminated with others who were in the midst and held flaming torches in their hands.

It was like the sun making the planets more radiant, or the sun fiercely illuminating the flames of a fire. That radiance spread on the earth and into the sky and spreading over all the directions, seemed to increase. The splendour was extremely fierce and made your soldiers, and theirs, visible. O king! As that radiance spread up towards the sky, the masses of gods, the gandharvas, the yakshas, the asuras and large numbers of siddhas were awakened and assembled, with all the apsaras. The place was full of gods, gandharvas, yakshas, leaders among the asuras, masses of apsaras and brave warriors who had been killed and had ascended to heaven. The field of battle looked like heaven itself. There were chariots, horses, elephants, all illuminated with lamps. Angry warriors roamed around and so did wounded horses. Those large armies of chariots, horses and elephants were arrayed in battle formation and were as resplendent as the gods and the asuras, arranged in vyuhas. The force of spears was like a turbulent wind. The large chariots were like clouds. There was the roar of chariots and horses. Weapons showered down, like clouds raining blood.

In that battle, in an instant, the foremost of brave rathas among the Vrishni lineage<a id="calibre_link-2169" href="#calibre_link-1521" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">153</sup></a> made Yudhishthira devoid of his horses, charioteer and chariot. The eldest of the Pandavas then grasped a sword and a shield. But in that battle, Madhava sliced these down with his sharp arrows. Yudhishthira then picked up a spear with a golden handle. It was difficult to resist and in that battle, he quickly hurled it towards Hardikya. It was released from Dharmaraja’s hands and descended suddenly. However, dexterous in the use of his hands, Hardikya severed it into two fragments and laughed. He then shrouded Dharma’s son with hundreds of arrows. He angrily cut down his armour with sharp arrows. The great-souled one’s armour was severed by Hardikya. O king! It fell down in that battle, like a stellar cluster dislodged from the firmament. His bow was severed. He was without a chariot. He was without armour. He was afflicted by arrows. Yudhishthira, Dharma’s son, quickly withdrew himself from that battle. Kritavarma defeated Yudhishthira, Dharma’s son. The immensely strong one again began to protect Drona’s wheel.”’</p>

In that battle, Bhuri descended on Shini’s descendant, who was supreme among rathas and was advancing like an elephant towards water. Satyaki became angry. He used five sharp arrows to quickly pierce him in the heart and blood began to flow. Shini’s descendant was indomitable in battle. But in that fashion, in that encounter, Kourava pierced him between the arms with ten sharp arrows. O great king! They wounded each other with terrible arrows. Their eyes were red with rage and they stretched their bows in anger. O great king! An extremely terrible shower of arrows rained down. Both of them were as angry as Death and released them from their bows. O king! They stationed themselves in that battle and shrouded each other with arrows. For a short while, the battle between the two seemed to be equal. O great king! However, extremely wrathful, Shini’s descendant laughed in that battle and severed the bow of the great-souled Kourava. Once the bow had been severed, he asked him to wait and quickly pierced him in the heart with nine sharp arrows. The scorcher of enemies was thus pierced by his powerful enemy. He grasped another bow and pierced Satvata back. O lord of the earth! Having pierced Satvata with three arrows, he used an extremely sharp broad-headed arrow to sever his bow and seemed to be smiling. O great king! With his bow severed, Satyaki became senseless with rage. He hurled an extremely forceful spear towards his chest. His limbs were shattered by that spear and he fell down from his supreme chariot. His limbs were red, like the one with the blazing rays in the sky.<a id="calibre_link-2170" href="#calibre_link-1522" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">154</sup></a></p>

On seeing that he was angrily advancing towards the chariot of Shini’s descendant, maharatha <a id="calibre_link-3418" class="calibre2"></a>Ghatotkacha let out a roar and spoke these words. ‘O Drona’s son! Wait. You will not escape from me with your life.

His eyes were coppery red with rage. Ghatotkacha showered down arrows that were as long as a chariot’s axle. Like clouds pouring down rain, he shrouded Drona’s son, bull among rathas. But, in that battle, Drona’s son quickly used his own arrows to counter those arrows, which were like venomous serpents, before they could reach him. He then used hundreds of sharp and swift arrows that were capable of penetrating the inner organs against Ghatotkacha, the scorcher of enemies and an Indra among rakshasas. O great king! Pierced by those arrows, the rakshasa looked beautiful in the forefront of the battle, like a porcupine with its quills erect. Bhimasena’s powerful son was overcome with rage. He showered down fierce arrows on Drona’s son and they had the sound of the vajra and thunder. There were kshurapras and those that were in the shape of a half-moon. There were those with iron heads. Some had tufts like a boar’s ear. Others were hollow and sharp. Still others had barbed tufts. That tumultuous shower of arrows made a sound like the vajra and thunder. They were angrily released and descended on him. However, the senses of Drona’s son were not numbed. That torrent of arrows was extremely difficult to withstand. However, the immensely energetic one invoked a divine weapon with a mantra and drove them away, like the wind dispelling large clouds. The arrows seemed to be fighting with each other in the sky. O great king! They were terrible in form and this increased the joy of the warriors. Because of the friction among the weapons, sparks were generated in every direction. At the commencement of the night, the <a id="calibre_link-3419" class="calibre2"></a>sky seemed to be covered with fireflies. Drona’s son covered all the directions with his arrows. To ensure the welfare of your sons, he countered the rakshasa.</p>

In the midst of that dark night, it was like that between Shakra and Prahlada. In that battle, Ghatotkacha was filled with extreme rage. He struck Drona’s son in the chest with ten arrows that were like the fire of destruction. Having been pierced in that battle by the rakshasa, Drona’s immensely strong son wavered, like a tree struck by a storm. He lost his senses and grasped the pole of his standard. O lord of men! Sounds of lamentation arose among all your soldiers. O lord of the earth! All those on your side thought that he had been killed. In that battle, on seeing that Ashvatthama was in that state, the Panchalas and Srinjayas roared like lions. Having regained his senses, the immensely strong Ashvatthama, the scorcher of enemies, drew his bow with his left hand. He drew the bow back up to his ear and quickly aimed a terrible and supreme arrow towards Ghatotkacha. It was like Yama’s staff. O lord of the earth! That supreme and fierce arrow, with excellent tufts, pierced the rakshasa’s heart and then entered the ground. O great king! Thus pierced by Drona’s son, who prided himself in battle, the Indra among rakshasas, who was extremely strong, sank down on the floor of his chariot. On seeing that Hidimba’s son was senseless in that field of battle, his charioteer was terrified and quickly bore him away from Drona’s son. Having thus pierced Ghatotkacha, Indra among rakshasas, in the battle, Drona’s immensely strong son let out a mighty roar. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! He was honoured by your sons and by all the warriors. His body blazed, like the sun at midday.</p>

Asking Bhima to wait, King Duryodhana pierced him with five arrows. Bhima severed his bow and his standard with nine arrows.

The immensely strong Bhimasena picked up another bow. He swiftly pierced the king with seven sharp arrows. Showing the dexterity of his hands, he<a id="calibre_link-2173" href="#calibre_link-1525" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">157</sup></a> severed his bow quickly and then a second, a third, a fourth and a fifth. O great king! Full of himself, he severed all the bows Bhima picked up. O great king! Your son was insolent about his prowess and wished for victory. On seeing that the bows were repeatedly severed, in that battle, he<a id="calibre_link-2174" href="#calibre_link-1526" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">158</sup></a> then hurled a sparkling lance that was made completely out of iron. But before that lance could reach him, Kourava severed it into three fragments, while all the worlds and the great-souled Bhima looked on. O great king! At this, Bhima grasped a heavy club that was extremely radiant. Powerfully, he hurled it towards Duryodhana’s chariot. O bull among the Bharata lineage! In that encounter, the heavy club forcefully crushed your son’s horses and charioteer. O Indra among kings! It also destroyed your son’s chariot, decorated with gold. He quickly descended from his chariot and ascended that of the great-souled Nandaka.<a id="calibre_link-2175" href="#calibre_link-1527" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">159</sup></a></p>

Karna pierced him back with one hundred arrows with straight tufts. Displaying the lightness of his hands, he quickly severed his bow. Madri’s powerful son picked up another bow. He pierced Karna with twenty arrows and it was extraordinary. Karna killed his horses with arrows with straight tufts. With a broad-headed arrow, he swiftly conveyed his charioteer to Yama’s eternal abode. Deprived of his chariot, Sahadeva grasped a sword and a shield. But Karna struck these down with his arrows and laughed. He<a id="calibre_link-2177" href="#calibre_link-1529" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">161</sup></a> then grasped an extremely terrible and extremely large club that was heavy and decorated with gold. In that battle, he hurled it towards Vaikartana’s chariot. It was violently released by Sahadeva and descended. Karna shattered it with his arrows and made it fall down on the ground. On seeing that the club had been destroyed, Sahadeva swiftly hurled a lance towards Karna. But it was struck down by the arrows. O great king! On seeing that Karna was stationed before him, Sahadeva was filled with rage and descended from his chariot. He picked up the wheel of a chariot and hurled it towards Adhiratha’s <a id="calibre_link-3427" class="calibre2"></a>son. It descended powerfully, like an upraised wheel of time. The son of a suta shattered it with thousands of arrows. Having rendered the wheel unsuccessful, the great-souled Sahadeva was restrained with arrows and left the battle. O bull among the Bharata lineage! For a short while, Radheya followed him. O lord of the earth! He laughed and spoke these words to Sahadeva. ‘O brave one! In a battle, do not fight with rathas who are superior. O son of Madri! Fight with those who are your equals. Do not entertain any doubt about my words.’ He then touched him with the tip of his bow and again spoke these words. ‘In the battle there, Arjuna is endeavouring to fight with the Kurus. O son of Madri! Go there. Or if you wish, go home.’ Having spoken those words, Karna, supreme among rathas, laughed. On his chariot, he proceeded towards the Panchala and Pandu soldiers. O king!

In that great battle, the king of Madra saw that Shatanika was approaching. He pierced him with many arrows and conveyed him to Yama’s eternal abode. When the brave one had been killed, Virata swiftly ascended his supreme chariot. That chariot was decorated with standards and garlands. His eyes were dilated with rage and his valour was doubled. He quickly enveloped the king of Madra’s chariot with arrows. The king of Madra became angry. He used a hundred arrows with straight tufts to firmly strike Virata, the leader of an army, in the chest. O great king! O bull among the Bharata lineage!

The flags were red and yellow and it was decorated with red garlands. It was made out of black iron and was covered with fierce and large bear skins. A fierce king of vultures was perched on the standard. Its wings were spotted and it dilated its eyes as it shrieked. It had an elongated beak. O king! That rakshasa was as beautiful as an unbroken mass of collyrium. He advanced against Arjuna, like a hurricane against a king of mountains. O king!

The great battle that took place between them was terrible in form, like the encounter between Shambara and the king of the immortals in the battle between the gods and the asuras.<a id="calibre_link-2198" href="#calibre_link-1550" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">182</sup></a> <a id="calibre_link-3443" class="calibre2"></a>The two maharathas covered the sky with nets of arrows. O foremost among the Bharatas! The night was naturally fierce in form and was rendered even more terrible by those two warriors, who were skilled in fighting. It was terrible in form and engendered fear. It was like a night of destruction.<a id="calibre_link-2199" href="#calibre_link-1551" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">183</sup></a> O great king! With an arrow that was in the shape of a half-moon, Shikandi sliced down Goutama’s giant bow and shot many arrows at him. O king! Kripa became angry at this and hurled a fierce javelin. The shaft was golden and it was sharp at the tip, having been polished by artisans. As it descended, Shikhandi struck it down with many arrows. It flamed as it fell down on the ground, dazzling and immensely radiant. O great king! Goutama, supreme among rathas, picked up another bow and shrouded Shikhandi with sharp arrows. Shikhandi, supreme among rathas, was enveloped in that encounter by the illustrious Goutama and losing his senses, sank down on the floor of his chariot. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! Beholding that he had become unconscious in the battle, Sharadvata Kripa wished to kill him and struck him with many arrows. Seeing that Yajnasena’s maharatha son could no longer fight in the encounter, the Panchalas and the Somakas surrounded him from all sides. Similarly, your sons also surrounded that best of brahmanas<a id="calibre_link-2200" href="#calibre_link-1552" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">184</sup></a> with a large army and the battle resumed again.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3444">‘“O king! In that encounter, rathas rushed against others. There was a tremendous sound, like that of clouds thundering. O lord of the earth! Horse riders and elephants were driven away. O king! They attacked each other and the field of battle became cruel. O great king! As the foot soldiers rushed, the earth trembled with their footsteps, like a lady trembling with fear. Rathas attacked even more powerfully, astride their chariots. O king! They were like crows, grabbing many locusts<a id="calibre_link-2201" href="#calibre_link-1553" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">185</sup></a> in the air. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! There were elephants with shattered temples, rushing against other giant elephants with shattered temples and trampling them with their <a id="calibre_link-3445" class="calibre2"></a>feet. Horse riders clashed against horse riders and infantry against infantry. In that encounter, they angrily rushed against each other. The soldiers advanced, retreated and returned again to the encounter. In the process, in the night, they raised an extremely loud uproar. There were blazing lamps on the chariots, elephants and horses. O great king! They seemed to be like giant meteors that had been dislodged from the sky. O foremost among the Bharata lineage! O king! The field of battle was illuminated by those lamps and it seemed to be like day. It was like a spreading sun that destroys the darkness in the world. In that fashion, that terrible darkness was dispelled by the light of those blazing lamps. All the weapons, the armour and the gems of the great-souled ones were overshadowed by the light from those blazing lamps. At the commencement of the night, there was a melee in the battle. O supreme among the Bharata lineage! In that encounter, the son killed the father and the father killed the son. The friend killed the friend, the relative killed the relative and the maternal uncle killed his sister’s son. They were confused. In that battle, they killed those on their own side, as well as on that of the enemy. They fought fearlessly during that terrible night and this engendered fear.”’</p>

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3447">‘Sanjaya said, “That tumultuous battle raged on, giving rise to great fear. O great king! Dhrishtadyumna advanced against Drona. He repeatedly tugged on the string of his supreme bow. He advanced towards Drona’s chariot, which was decorated with gold. O great king! As Dhrishtadyumna advanced, wishing to get at Drona, the Panchalas and the Pandavas surrounded him. On seeing that Drona, supreme among preceptors, had been surrounded, your son made efforts to protect Drona in that battle. During that night, the two clashing armies looked like oceans. They were like fierce oceans <a id="calibre_link-3448" class="calibre2"></a>that had been stirred and agitated by a storm, with all the beings in them disturbed.”</p>

Panchala<a id="calibre_link-2202" href="#calibre_link-1554" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">186</sup></a> quickly pierced Drona in the chest with five arrows and roared like a lion. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! In that encounter, Drona pierced him with twenty-five arrows and with another broad-headed arrow, severed his immensely radiant bow. O bull among the Bharata lineage! Having been thus pierced by Drona, Dhrishtadyumna swiftly abandoned that bow and bit his lower lip in rage. O great king! Having become wrathful, the powerful Dhrishtadyumna picked up another excellent bow, wishing to bring about Drona’s destruction. The destroyer of enemy heroes drew the colourful bow back up to his ear. He released a fierce arrow that was capable of taking Drona’s life. In the great battle, the powerful one released that terrible arrow. It illuminated all the soldiers, as if the sun had arisen. O king! On seeing that terrible arrow, the gods, the gandharvas and men spoke these words. ‘May Drona be safe in this encounter.’ O king! But before that arrow could reach the preceptor’s chariot, Karna displayed the lightness of his hands and shattered it into twelve fragments. O king! O venerable one! It was thus shattered into many fragments by the son of a suta. Quickly rendered unsuccessful by Karna’s arrows, that arrow fell down. Having severed the arrow in the battle with his straight-tufted arrows, in that encounter, Karna pierced Dhrishtadyumna with ten arrows. Drona’s son pierced him with five, Drona himself with seven, Shalya with nine arrows and Duhshasana with three. Duryodhana pierced him with twenty and Shakuni with five. All the maharathas quickly pierced Panchala. For Drona’s sake, he was thus pierced by seven heroes in that battle.<a id="calibre_link-2203" href="#calibre_link-1555" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">187</sup></a> O king! But without showing any fear, he pierced each of them back with three arrows. He pierced Drona, Drona’s son, Karna and your son. Thus pierced by that archer, those supreme among rathas again quickly pierced Dhrishtadyumna in that battle, with five arrows each.</p>

Drumasena<a id="calibre_link-2204" href="#calibre_link-1556" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">188</sup></a> angrily pierced him with arrows. Asking him to wait, he again swiftly struck him with three other arrows. He pierced him back with three fast and sharp arrows. They were gold-tufted and sharpened on stone. They could rob warriors of their lives. He again used a broad-headed arrow to sever the valiant Drumasena’s head, with golden and blazing earrings, from his body. The teeth still bit the lower lips in anger. But in that battle, the head fell down on the ground. It was like a ripe palm fruit, which had been brought down by the force of a strong wind.”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3452">‘“The brave one again struck those brave ones with extremely sharp arrows. Colourful in fighting, he severed Radheya’s bow with a broad-headed arrow. Karna could not tolerate the severing of his bow, like a fierce lion whose tail has been severed. His eyes became red with rage and he sighed. He picked up another bow. He showered down a storm of arrows on the immensely strong Dhrishtadyumna. On seeing that Karna was enraged, those brave ones, the six bulls among men,<a id="calibre_link-2205" href="#calibre_link-1557" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">189</sup></a> quickly surrounded Panchala’s son, wishing to kill him. On seeing that he was in front of those supreme warriors, all those on your side thought that Dhrishtadyumna was already within the jaws of death. At that time, Dasharha Satyaki showered arrows and advanced to the spot where the valorous Dhrishtadyumna was. Satyaki was a great archer and indomitable in battle. On seeing that he was advancing, Radheya pierced him back with ten swift arrows. O great king! While all those brave ones looked on, Satyaki asked him to wait and not run away, and then pierced him with ten arrows. The encounter between the powerful Satyaki and the great-souled Karna was terrible, like that between Bali and Vasava. With the slapping of his palms, Satyaki, bull among the kshatriyas, frightened all the kshatriyas and pierced the lotus-eyed Karna back. O great king! Making the earth tremble with the roar of his bow, the powerful son of a suta fought against Satyaki. Karna pierced Shini’s <a id="calibre_link-3453" class="calibre2"></a>descendant back with hundreds of arrows&mdash;vipatha, <em class="calibre4">karni</em>, naracha, <em class="calibre4">vatsadanta</em> and <em class="calibre4">kshurapra</em>.<a id="calibre_link-2206" href="#calibre_link-1558" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">190</sup></a> In that way, Yuyudhana, foremost of rathas among the Vrishni lineage, showered down arrows on Karna.

Karna’s armoured son<a id="calibre_link-2207" href="#calibre_link-1559" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">191</sup></a> quickly pierced Satyaki from every direction with sharp arrows. The lord Satyaki used his weapons to counter all their weapons and those of Karna. He angrily pierced Vrishasena between the breasts. O lord of the earth! Pierced by that arrow, the valiant Vrishasena lost his senses. He discarded his bow and fell down on his chariot. Karna thought that maharatha Vrishasena had been slain. He was tormented by sorrow on account of his son and afflicted Satyaki. Maharatha Yuyudhana was oppressed by Karna. But he repeatedly struck Karna back with many arrows and with force. He pierced Karna with ten arrows and Vrishasena with seven. Satvata severed the bows and arm-guards of both. They<a id="calibre_link-2208" href="#calibre_link-1560" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">192</sup></a> strung other bows that were capable of terrifying the enemy and pierced Yuyudhana from every direction with sharp arrows.

<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3454">‘“O king! Surpassing all sounds, the great roar of Gandiva was heard. O king! On hearing the clatter of the chariot and the roar of Gandiva, the son of a suta spoke these words to Duryodhana. ‘The great archer has killed all the Shibis, the foremost of bulls among men and the Pouravas.<a id="calibre_link-2209" href="#calibre_link-1561" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">193</sup></a> Gandiva is roaring loudly. The clatter of the chariot can be heard and Vasava’s son is roaring. It is evident that Pandava has accomplished deeds that only he himself is capable of. O king! He will shatter this army of the Bharatas in many ways. The <a id="calibre_link-3455" class="calibre2"></a>soldiers are being routed and no one wishes to remain. It is as if a net of clouds is being dispelled by the wind. Approaching Savyasachi, those on our side are being broken, like a boat on the ocean. Because of the arrows released from Gandiva, the foremost of the warriors are fleeing. O king! As they are being routed in a hundred ways, a large uproar can be heard. O tiger among kings! In this night, it is echoing in the sky. There are the sounds of lamentations and roars like lions’. Musical instruments and many other sounds can be heard in the vicinity of Arjuna’s chariot. However, Satyaki, worst of the Satvata lineage, is stationed in our midst. If we can attain this objective of ours,<a id="calibre_link-2210" href="#calibre_link-1562" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">194</sup></a> all our enemies will be defeated.

He is surrounded on all sides by warriors who are supreme among men. O great king! If we kill Satyaki and Parshata Dhrishtadyumna, there is no doubt about the certainty that victory will be ours.

Let the brave ones quickly release fierce arrows, so that Madhava can quickly go to the world of the hereafter.’ O king! Knowing this to be Karna’s view, your son spoke to Soubala in that encounter, like Indra speaking to the illustrious Vishnu. ‘Surrounded by tens of thousands of elephants that do not retreat and surrounded by ten thousand chariots, go to where Dhananjaya is. Duhshasana, Durvishaha, Subahu and Dushpradharshana will follow you, surrounded by many foot soldiers. O mighty-armed one! O maternal uncle!

Having been thus addressed by your son, Soubala went to where the Parthas were, with a large army and with your sons. For the welfare of your sons, he wished to consume the sons of Pandu.</p>

O descendant of the Bharata lineage! During that night, the great-souled Drona fought a great battle against the brave Dhrishtadyumna and the Panchalas.”’</p>

They were angry and intolerant and advanced towards Yuyudhana’s chariot. O king! They were on well-constructed chariots that were decorated with gold and jewels. With horses and elephants, they surrounded Satvata. Those maharathas penned him in from all directions. They roared like lions and challenged Satyaki. They showered down many sharp arrows on Satyaki, for whom, truth was his valour. Those spirited and immensely valorous ones desired to kill Madhava. On seeing them swiftly advance, Shini’s mighty-armed descendant, the destroyer of enemy heroes, received them and shot many swift arrows. Satyaki was a brave and great archer and invincible in battle. He severed heads with his fierce arrows that had straight tufts. With his kshurapra arrows, Madhava severed the trunks of elephants, the necks of horses and the arms of many on your side, still holding on to weapons. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! Whisks and white umbrellas fell down. O lord! The earth <a id="calibre_link-3460" class="calibre2"></a>was beautiful, like the firmament full of stars. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! As they fought in that battle with Yuyudhana, there was a tremendous uproar, like that of dead spirits wailing. The earth became full of that great sound. The night assumed a terrible form, giving rise to great fear. Your army was shattered and afflicted by Yuyudhana’s arrows. In the night, there was a tremendous roar and it made the body hair stand up.</p>

On seeing this, your son, supreme among rathas, repeatedly spoke to his charioteer and urged him. ‘Goad these supreme horses towards that spot.’ The charioteer drove towards Yuyudhana’s chariot. Duryodhana was angry. He was firm in wielding the bow and had conquered exhaustion. He was swift in the use of his hands and was a colourful fighter. He attacked Yuyudhana. Madhava drew his bow all the way back and pierced Duryodhana with twelve arrows that drank up blood. Despite being first afflicted by the arrows of Shini’s descendant, Duryodhana intolerantly pierced him back with ten arrows. O bull among the Bharata lineage! The battle between the Panchalas and all the Bharatas became tumultuous and fierce. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! Shini’s descendant became angry in that battle. He pierced your maharatha son in the chest with eighty arrows. In that encounter, he used other arrows to convey his mounts to Yama’s eternal abode. Using his arrows, he quickly brought down the charioteer from his chariot. O lord of the earth! With his horses slain, your son remained stationed on the chariot. He released many sharp arrows in the direction of the chariot of Shini’s descendant. O king! In that encounter, Shini’s descendant showed the dexterity of his hands. He sliced down the five hundred arrows that had been released by your son. O venerable one! Violent in that battle, he used a broad-headed arrow to sever your son’s giant bow from his hand. Without a chariot and without a bow, the lord and master of all worlds quickly climbed onto Kritavarma’s radiant chariot. O lord of the earth! In the middle of the night, when Duryodhana had retreated, Shini’s descendant used his arrows to drive away your army.</p>

He killed many warriors on your side, like the one with the vajra in his hand against the asuras. O great king! Arms and thousands of bodies were mangled. They were scattered around and the earth looked beautiful, as if strewn with flowers. He severely pierced Shakuni with five arrows with drooping tufts.

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3475">‘Sanjaya said, “Karna, the destroyer of enemy heroes, was delighted at seeing Parshata in the battle. He struck him in the chest with ten arrows that were capable of penetrating the inner organs. O venerable one! Dhrishtadyumna swiftly pierced him back with five arrows, cheerfully asking him to wait. In that encounter, those great maharathas used other arrows to envelop each other and drawing their bows all the way back, pierced each other. In that battle, Karna used his arrows to pierce the charioteer and the four horses of Dhrishtadyumna, foremost among the Panchalas. He severed his supreme bow with sharp arrows and used a broad-headed arrow to bring down his charioteer from the seat on the chariot. Dhrishtadyumna was without a chariot. His horses were slain. His charioteer was killed. He grasped a terrible club and crushed Karna’s horses. He<a id="calibre_link-2224" href="#calibre_link-1576" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">208</sup></a> was severely wounded by many arrows that were like venomous serpents. O venerable one! He advanced towards <a id="calibre_link-3476" class="calibre2"></a>Yudhishthira’s army on foot and climbed onto Sahadeva’s chariot. The charioteer yoked other horses to Karna’s chariot. They possessed the complexion of conch shells and were extremely fast. They were from the Saindhava region and were controlled well.<a id="calibre_link-2225" href="#calibre_link-1577" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">209</sup></a> Successful in attaining his objective, Radheya afflicted the maharatha Panchalas with his arrows, like clouds raining down on a mountain. The large army of the Panchalas was afflicted by Karna. They fled in fright, like deer assailed by a lion. Horses and elephants fell down on the ground. Here and there, men were seen to swiftly fall down from their chariots. In the great battle, Karna killed the fleeing warriors with his kshurapra arrows and severed arms and heads, still adorned with earrings. O lord of the earth! O venerable one! The thighs of those who were astride elephants, those who were on the backs of horses and those who were on the ground, were severed. But as they fled in the battle, many maharathas did not feel that their limbs or their mounts were severed by arrows. Slaughtered in the battle, the Panchalas and the Srinjayas thought that even the stirring of a blade of grass was the son of the suta. As they were frightened and fled in the battle, the warriors were deprived of their senses and took those on their own side to be Karna and fled in fright. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! As the shattered army fled, Karna quickly pursued it from the rear, showering arrows. They glanced at each other, unconscious and bereft of their senses. They were incapable of standing before the great-souled one, who was like Death. O king! The Panchalas were struck by Karna’s supreme arrows. Others glanced towards Drona and fled in all the directions.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3477">‘“King Yudhishthira saw that his own army was running away. Thinking that retreat was preferable, he spoke these words to Phalguna. ‘Behold. The great archer, Karna, is stationed with a bow in his hand. Though it is a dreadful night, he is scorching like the sun. The whizzing sounds of Karna’s arrows are being incessantly heard. O Partha! Your relatives seem to be without a protector. He is swiftly affixing and releasing arrows. It is certain that he will destroy us and I see that the valiant one’s victory is certain. The time has <a id="calibre_link-3478" class="calibre2"></a>come. Adopt the course of action that you think to be appropriate next. O Dhananjaya! Do what needs to be done to kill Karna.’ Having been thus addressed, the mighty-armed Partha spoke to Krishna. ‘The king is frightened of the supreme valour of Radheya, the son of Kunti. Karna’s army is repeatedly acting and the time has come. Our army is running away and we must quickly decide on a course of action. O Madhusudana! They are being mangled by Drona’s arrows. They are frightened of Karna and are unable to take a stand. Behold. Karna is fearlessly roaming around there. He is showering sharp arrows and driving away the best of rathas. O tiger among the Vrishni lineage! Like a snake that has been stepped on with a foot, I cannot bear to see him wander around thus on the field of battle and remain oblivious. Therefore, swiftly go to the spot where maharatha Karna is. O Madhusudana! I will kill him. Or let him kill me.’ Vasudeva replied, ‘O Kounteya! I have seen Karna roaming around in the battle, like the king of the gods. He is a tiger among men and superhuman in his valour. O Dhananjaya! O tiger among men! With the exception of you and the rakshasa Ghatotkacha, there is no one else who can counter him in battle. O unblemished one! O mighty-armed one! I do not think that the time has come for you to confront the son of a suta in battle. He possesses a blazing spear that he obtained from Vasava. O mighty-armed one! It is terrible in form and he has retained it for you. Let the immensely strong Ghatotkacha advance against Radheya. He has been born from the powerful Bhima and is like the gods in valour. He possesses divine weapons and also those of the rakshasas and asuras. Ghatotkacha has always been devoted to you and has your welfare in mind. It is my view that there is no doubt about his defeating Karna in the battle.’ Having thus spoken to Partha, the mighty-armed and lotus-eyed one summoned the rakshasa.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3479">‘“O lord of the earth! He arrived before them, with armour, arrows, sword and bow. He paid his respects to Krishna and Pandava Dhananjaya. He cheerfully addressed them, ‘Command me.’ He was like a cloud. He was radiant and was adorned with blazing earrings. Dasharha smiled and spoke to Hidimba’s son. ‘O Ghatotkacha! O child! Listen to what I tell you. The time has come for you, and no one <a id="calibre_link-3480" class="calibre2"></a>else, to show valour. Be a raft to your relatives, who are submerging. You possess many kinds of weapons and the maya of rakshasas. O Hidimba’s son! Behold. The Pandava army is being driven away by Karna in the field of battle, like cattle by a herdsman. It is my view that this great archer, Karna, is firm in his valour. The bull among kshatriyas is slaughtering the Pandava soldiers. The one with the firm bow is releasing a great shower of arrows. Oppressed by the rays of his arrows, no one is capable of standing before him. In this night, the son of a suta is afflicting them with his shower of arrows. The Panchalas are being driven away, like frightened deer before a lion. O one who is terrible in valour! With your exception, there is no one else who can be seen, capable of countering the son of a suta, when he is thus engaged in battle. O mighty-armed one! Perform the deeds that only you are capable of. You possess the energies of your maternal uncle<a id="calibre_link-2226" href="#calibre_link-1578" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">210</sup></a> and fathers and have the strength of your weapons. O Hidimba’s son! It is for reasons like this that men desire sons, to save them in times of difficulty. Therefore, save your relatives. The strength of your weapons is fierce. Your maya is difficult to withstand. O son of Bhima! You have always fought in a battle. The Pandavas have been routed by Karna’s sharp arrows. O scorcher of enemies! They are sinking in the ocean of the sons of Dhritarashtra and cannot reach the shore. During the night, the rakshasas become invested with extreme valour, power and bravery. They roam around valiantly and are invincible. Using maya in the battle, slay the great archer, Karna, during the night. The Parthas, with Dhrishtadyumna at the forefront, will kill Drona.’ O Kouravya! On hearing the words of Keshava, Bibhatsu, the scorcher of enemies, also spoke to the rakshasa Ghatotkacha. ‘O Ghatotkacha! In my view, you, the mighty-armed Satyaki and Pandava Bhimasena are the best among all our soldiers. In the night, go and engage in a duel with Karna. Maharatha Satyaki will protect your rear. Aided by Satvata, slay the brave Karna in the battle, just as Indra, aided by Skanda, struck Taraka in ancient times.’<a id="calibre_link-2227" href="#calibre_link-1579" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">211</sup></a> <a id="calibre_link-3481" class="calibre2"></a>Ghatotkacha replied, ‘I am a match for Karna, the supreme Drona and all the other kshatriyas who are skilled in the use of weapons. In this night, I will present the son of the suta with a battle. People will speak about it as long as this earth lasts. I will not save brave ones, or those who are frightened and join their hands in salutation. I will resort to the dharma of rakshasas and kill everyone.’ Having spoken thus, Hidimba’s mighty-armed son, the destroyer of enemy heroes, violently advanced against Karna, frightening your soldiers.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3482">‘“On seeing that he was angrily descending, like an insect towards a flame, the son of a suta, the supreme archer, received him. At night, a battle commenced between Karna and the rakshasa. O tiger among kings! They roared at each other, like Shakra and Prahlada.”’</p>
<h5 class="eb07smallcapsmediumhead" id="calibre_link-3483">Chapter 1126(149)</h5>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3484">‘Sanjaya said, “O king! Ghatotkacha spiritedly advanced towards the chariot of the son of a suta, desiring to kill Karna in the battle. On seeing this, your son<a id="calibre_link-2228" href="#calibre_link-1580" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">212</sup></a> spoke these words to Duhshasana. ‘On witnessing Karna’s valour in the battle, this rakshasa is swiftly advancing. Advance quickly and prevent this maharatha from reaching Karna. Surround yourself with a large army and go to the spot where the immensely strong Karna is stationed. Vaikartana is fighting with the rakshasa in this battle. O one who grants honours! Surrounded by the soldiers, make an effort to protect Karna in the battle.’ O king! At this time, Jatasura’s powerful son approached Duryodhana. He was supreme among strikers and spoke. ‘O Duryodhana! Your enemies are famous and invincible in battle. But with your permission, I wish to kill the Pandavas and their followers. In earlier times, my father, Jatasura, was the foremost among rakshasas. Performing a deed that could kill rakshasas, the inferior Parthas brought him down.<a id="calibre_link-2229" href="#calibre_link-1581" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">213</sup></a> O <a id="calibre_link-3485" class="calibre2"></a>lord!

But with my permission, go. Slay Ghatotkacha in the battle.’ Having been thus addressed, the one with a gigantic form challenged Ghatotkacha.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3486">‘“Jatasura’s son countered Bhimasena’s son with diverse kinds of weapons. However, Hidimba’s son crushed Alambala,<a id="calibre_link-2231" href="#calibre_link-1583" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">215</sup></a> Karna and the unassailable Kuru soldiers, like a giant wind driving away clouds. On seeing that the ratha Ghatotkacha was using maya, Alambala quickly shot many different kinds of arrows at him. Alambala pierced Bhimasena’s son with many arrows. He drove away the Pandava soldiers with his storm of arrows. O venerable one! The Pandava soldiers were thus driven away in the night, like clouds dispelled by the wind. O king! Similarly, the Kuru soldiers were mangled by Ghatotkacha’s arrows and fled in the night, throwing away thousands of flaming torches. Alambala became angry in that great battle. He struck Bhimasena’s son with many arrows, like a giant elephant being goaded. Ghatotkacha shattered into tiny fragments his<a id="calibre_link-2232" href="#calibre_link-1584" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">216</sup></a> chariot, his charioteer and all the fierce weapons, capable of destroying life, that were hurled at him. Like clouds raining down on Mount Meru, he showered down thousands of storms of arrows on Karna, the other Kurus and Alambala. Afflicted by the rakshasa, the Kuru soldiers were agitated. The four kinds of forces<a id="calibre_link-2233" href="#calibre_link-1585" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">217</sup></a> began to crush each other down repeatedly. O great king! Jatasura’s son was without a chariot. His charioteer was slain. In that battle, he angrily struck Ghatotkacha with a firm blow of the fist. Having been struck by the fist, Ghatotkacha wavered, like a mountain, with its large number of trees and creepers, as if during an earthquake. He then raised his arms, which were like clubs and capable of slaying the enemy. Bhimasena’s son severely struck Jatasura’s son with his fist. <a id="calibre_link-3487" class="calibre2"></a>Hidimba’s son angrily crushed him and swiftly hurled him down. He seized him with arms that were like Indra’s standard and forced him down on the ground. Alambala also seized the rakshasa Ghatotkacha in the encounter and wrathfully seizing him, forced him down on the ground. There was a duel between those gigantic ones, Ghatotkacha and Alambala. As they roared, it was tumultuous and made the body hair stand up. In particular, they were well versed in maya and resorted to maya to overpower each other. Those immensely valiant ones fought, like Indra and Virochana’s son.<a id="calibre_link-2234" href="#calibre_link-1586" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">218</sup></a> They became fire and the ocean<a id="calibre_link-2235" href="#calibre_link-1587" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">219</sup></a> and Garuda and Takshaka.<a id="calibre_link-2236" href="#calibre_link-1588" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">220</sup></a> They again became a cloud and a giant wind, or thunder and a giant mountain.

In this way, wishing to kill each each other, they created a hundred different kinds of maya. Alambala and Ghatotkacha fought wonderfully well. They struck each other with clubs, maces, lances, bludgeons, battleaxes, mallets and the summits of mountains. The foremost among rakshasa warriors resorted to great powers of maya and fought as horses, elephants, infantry and chariots. O king! Wishing to kill Alambala, Ghatotkacha descended violently, like a hawk. The Indra among rakshasas seized Alambala, whose form was gigantic. He raised him and pressed him down in the battle, like Vishnu against Maya.<a id="calibre_link-2238" href="#calibre_link-1590" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">222</sup></a> Ghatotkacha grasped a sword that was extraordinary to look at. He severed the terrible head from the body and it was dreadful to see.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3488">‘“The rakshasa grasped the head by the hair, with the blood dripping from it. Ghatotkacha then swiftly advanced towards Duryodhana’s chariot. The mighty-armed rakshasa approached and <a id="calibre_link-3489" class="calibre2"></a>smiling, flung the head, with a distorted face and dreadful hair, onto the chariot. He then roared loudly, like a cloud during the monsoon. O king! He spoke these words to Duryodhana. ‘Witness the valour of your friend. He has been killed. You will now witness Karna’s destruction and that of your own self.’ O lord of men! Having said this, he departed in Karna’s direction. He shot hundreds of sharp arrows towards Karna’s head. O great king! A duel commenced between the man and the rakshasa in that battle and it was terrible in form. It gave rise to great fear and was wonderful.”’</p>

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3491">‘Dhritarashtra asked, “Vaikartana Karna and the rakshasa Ghatotkacha clashed against each other in the night. Tell me about that wonderful event. What kind of terrible fight did the rakshasa resort to? What kind of chariot did he create with his maya and what were his weapons? What were the sizes of his horses, chariot, standard and bow? What was his armour like and the guard around his neck? O Sanjaya! You are skilled in narrating. I am asking you. Tell me all this.”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3492">‘Sanjaya replied, “His eyes were red. His form was gigantic. He had the complexion of copper. His stomach hung low. His body hair stood up. His hair was green. His eyes were like cones. His jaw was large. His gaping jaw was wide, extending from one ear to another. His teeth were pointed and looked deadly. His tongue and lips were extremely long, with the hue of copper. His eyebrows were long. His nose was thick. His body was blue. His neck was red. He was as tall as a mountain and was a terrible sight. His form was gigantic. He was mighty-armed, with a large head, and immensely strong. His body was harsh to the touch. The hair was tied into a fierce bun on his head. His hips were broad. His navel was deep. But though he was gigantic, his waist was thin. The ornaments on his arms were also appropriate. He wore armlets and possessed great powers of maya. <a id="calibre_link-3493" class="calibre2"></a>He wore a breastplate that was like a garland of fire on a mountain. A dazzling crown adorned his head. It was as large as a gate. It was golden and colourful and it had many beautiful segments. His earrings were like the rising sun. His golden garland sparkled. His gigantic body was bedecked in extremely radiant armour made of brass. The giant chariot, which was as large as a <em class="calibre4">nalva</em>,<a id="calibre_link-2239" href="#calibre_link-1591" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">223</sup></a> roared with a hundred bells. It was covered with bear skins. The standard and flags were red. It possessed a standard and garlands and was stocked with all the supreme weapons. It possessed eight wheels and rumbled deeply, like a cloud. It was borne by powerful horses. They were fierce, with red eyes, and looked like elephants. They were swift and adopted whatever complexion one wished. The rakshasa Virupaksha was the charioteer and he was resplendent, with earrings. The reins were like the rays of the sun and he grasped these and controlled the horses in battle. He arrived with him, like the sun god with Varuna. A giant standard was raised aloft the chariot. It looked like a giant mountain, encircled by giant clouds. It seemed to stretch up into the sky. An extremely fierce and carnivorous vulture was perched on it and its head was red. The chariot roared like Vasava’s vajra. The bejewelled bow could slay the enemy and was twelve kishkus long.<a id="calibre_link-2240" href="#calibre_link-1592" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">224</sup></a> The bowstring was firm when stretched. The arrows were as long as a chariot’s axle and he enveloped all the directions with these. In the night that was destructive of brave ones, he advanced towards Karna. He was stationed on that chariot and stretched his bow. The roar of the bow, when stretched, was heard to be like the sound of thunder. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! This terrified your soldiers. All of them trembled, like giant waves on the ocean.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3494">‘“On seeing the fierce one with the malformed eyes advance, Radheya seemed to smile and quickly countered him. Karna approached the smiling one<a id="calibre_link-2241" href="#calibre_link-1593" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">225</sup></a> and struck him from a close distance. He was like an elephant against another elephant, like the bull who <a id="calibre_link-3495" class="calibre2"></a>leads a herd against another bull. O lord of the earth! O king! There was a tumultuous clash between Karna and the rakshasa, like that between Indra and Shambara. They grasped immensely powerful bows that made a fierce noise. They enveloped and struck each other with giant arrows. They drew their bows all the way back and released straight-tufted arrows. They countered each other and pierced the brass armour. They were like tigers fighting with their claws, or giant elephants with their tusks. They flung spears<a id="calibre_link-2242" href="#calibre_link-1594" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">226</sup></a> at each other and wounded each other with their arrows. They mangled each other’s limbs and struck each other with arrows. They scorched each other with storms of arrows and it was impossible to look at either of them. They were wounded all over their limbs and they were covered with streams of blood. They looked beautiful, like mountains covered with red ore, with streams flowing down them. Their limbs were pierced with the tips of arrows and they mangled each other. But though those immensely radiant ones struggled, neither could make the other tremble. O king! For a long time, that duel in the night seemed to be equal. Karna and the rakshasa gambled in that battle, with their lives as stakes. They affixed sharp arrows and shot them. They terrified those on their own side, and on the side of the enemy, with the roars of their bows. O king! Karna could not get the better of Ghatotkacha.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3496">‘“The supreme among those who have knowledge of weapons then invoked a divine weapon. On seeing that Karna had invoked a divine weapon, the rakshasa Ghatotkacha, the descendant of the Pandu lineage, created a great maya. He was surrounded by a large army of rakshasas, fierce in visage. They wielded spears and clubs and held mountains and trees in their hands. On seeing that he<a id="calibre_link-2243" href="#calibre_link-1595" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">227</sup></a> had raised his great bow, all the kings were distressed. He advanced like the destroyer of all beings, like Yama wielding a staff. Ghatotkacha emitted terrible roars like a lion. The elephants passed urine and the men were severely distressed. A large and fierce shower of stones rained down in every direction. It was midnight and the powerful <a id="calibre_link-3497" class="calibre2"></a>rakshasas released these with their enhanced strength. Iron chakras, catapults, lances, javelins, spears, shataghnis and battleaxes rained down incessantly. The kings saw that the battle had become extremely fierce and terrible. Your sons and the warriors were distressed and fled. There was only a single proud one who was not distressed. This was Karna, who prided himself on the strength of his weapons. Using his arrows, he destroyed the maya that had been created by Ghatotkacha. When that maya was dispelled, Ghatokacha became intolerant. He released a terrible shower of deadly arrows towards the son of the suta. In the great battle, these arrows penetrated Karna and covered with blood, entered the ground, like angry snakes. The powerful son of the suta was enraged and using the dexterity of his hands, surpassed Ghatotkacha and pierced him with ten arrows. Ghatotkacha was pierced in his inner organs by the son of the suta. Severely wounded, he picked up a divine chakra with one thousand spokes. The edges were as sharp as a razor and it was decorated with gems and jewels. Its complexion was like that of the rising sun. Wishing to kill him, Bhimasena’s son angrily hurled this towards Adhiratha’s son. It was hurled with great force. However, Karna struck it with his arrows and rendered it unsuccessful, like the wishes of an unfortunate person. It fell down on the ground. On seeing that the chakra had been brought down, Ghatotkacha became extremely angry. He shrouded Karna with arrows, like Svarbhanu eclipsing the sun. The son of the suta possessed the valour of Indra and Upendra<a id="calibre_link-2244" href="#calibre_link-1596" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">228</sup></a> and was not frightened. He swiftly enveloped Ghatotkacha’s chariot with arrows. Enraged, Ghatotkacha grasped a club decorated with gold and hurled it. While it was still traversing, Karna shattered it with his arrows and made it fall down.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3498">‘“Bhimasena’s son, gigantic in form, rose up into the sky. He roared like a dark cloud. He brought down a shower of trees from the sky, using his powers of maya. Karna pierced him with his arrows, like the rays of the sun passing through a mass of clouds. Karna killed all his horses and shattered his chariot into a hundred fragments. He showered down arrows, like a cloud pouring down rain. There wasn’t <a id="calibre_link-3499" class="calibre2"></a>a stretch of two fingers on his<a id="calibre_link-2245" href="#calibre_link-1597" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">229</sup></a> body that was not pierced. In a short while, he seemed to be like a porcupine with its quills erect. In that encounter, he was enveloped with a storm of arrows and we could not see his horses, his chariot, his standard, or even Ghatotkacha. He then used his own weapons to destroy Karna’s divine weapon. The one who knew about maya resorted to fighting with maya in the battle with the son of the suta. Showing his dexterity, he used maya to fight with Karna. Invisible in the sky, he brought down a net of arrows. O supreme among the Kuru lineage! Bhimasena’s son was great in the use of maya and resorted to maya. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! Using his great maya, he caused confusion. Using maya, he assumed many inauspicious faces with distorted mouths and these devoured the divine weapons of the son of the suta. In that battle, the one with the gigantic form again seemed to be shattered into a hundred fragments. He was seen to lie down, deprived of his life and deprived of his endeavour. On thinking that he had been slain, the bulls among the Kurus roared in delight. However, he was then seen in all the directions, assuming new bodies. He again assumed a giant form, with one hundred heads and one hundred stomachs. The mighty-armed one looked like Mount Mainaka. However, the rakshasa again assumed a form that was as small as a finger. He rose up, like the waves of the ocean. He executed diagonal motions. He seemed to shatter the earth and immerse himself in the waters. He became invisible and was then seen in a different place. He descended from his chariot, decorated in gold, and again ascended it. Covered in maya, the armoured one was seen on earth, in the sky and in all the directions.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3500">‘“O lord of the earth! He fearlessly approached Karna’s chariot, earrings adorning his face and waving around, and spoke these words to the son of the suta. ‘O son of a suta! Wait. With your life, you will not be able to go away from me. On this field of battle today, I will destroy all the affection that you have for fighting.’ Having spoken these words, the rakshasa, whose eyes were coppery red with anger and whose valour was cruel, rose up into the sky and laughed <a id="calibre_link-3501" class="calibre2"></a>loudly. He struck Karna, like a lion striking a king of elephants. He showered down arrows on Karna, bull among rathas, like a cloud pouring down rain. These arrows were as long as a chariot’s axle, and Ghatotkacha showered them down. But Karna destroyed this from a distance. O bull among the Bharata lineage! On seeing that his maya had been destroyed by Karna, Ghatotkacha used his maya and disappeared again. He became a lofty mountain with many peaks full of trees. From that, a large stream of lances, spears, swords and clubs issued forth like water. On seeing that mountain, which was like a mass of collyrium and from which many kinds of fierce weapons showered down, Karna was not agitated. He seemed to smile as he invoked a divine weapon. Because of that weapon, that large mountain was flung away and destroyed. He<a id="calibre_link-2246" href="#calibre_link-1598" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">230</sup></a> became a blue cloud in the sky, with Indra’s weapon<a id="calibre_link-2247" href="#calibre_link-1599" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">231</sup></a> in it. He showered down fierce stones on the son of a suta. However, Karna Vaikartana Vrisha,<a id="calibre_link-2248" href="#calibre_link-1600" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">232</sup></a> supreme among those who have knowledge of all weapons, affixed a vayavya weapon and destroyed that dark cloud. Using a large number of arrows, Karna scattered it in all the directions. O great king! He destroyed the weapon that had been used by Ghatotkacha. In that battle, Bhimasena’s immensely strong son laughed. He used his great maya against maharatha Karna. Ghatotkacha, supreme among rathas, again advanced towards him on a chariot. He was not frightened and was surrounded by many rakshasas. They were like lions and tigers and like crazy elephants in their valour. Some were astride elephants, others were astride chariots. And there were others who were on the backs of horses. They wielded many kinds of terrible weapons. They were adorned with diverse armour and ornaments. Those cruel ones surrounded Ghatotkacha, like the Maruts around Vasava.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3502">‘“On seeing this, Karna, the great archer, began to fight with the rakshasa. Ghatotkacha pierced Karna with five swift arrows. He roared loudly and terrified all the kings. Ghatotkacha again used an <a id="calibre_link-3503" class="calibre2"></a>anjalika arrow and quickly severed the bow in Karna’s hand, with many large arrows still affixed to it. Karna picked up another firm and large bow, capable of bearing a burden. It was as large as Indra’s weapon<a id="calibre_link-2249" href="#calibre_link-1601" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">233</sup></a> and he drew it back powerfully. O great king! Karna shot gold-tufted arrows that were capable of killing the enemy towards the rakshasas who were in the sky. The rakshasas were broad in the chest and those arrows shattered their herd. It was as if a herd of wild elephants were being oppressed by a lion. The rakshasas were destroyed by those arrows of the lord, together with their horses, charioteers and elephants. The illustrious one consumed them, like the fire consumes all beings at the time of the destruction of a yuga. Having killed the rakshasa soldiers, the son of a suta was resplendent. It was like the city of Tripura, being burnt in earlier times in the sky, by the god Maheshvara.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3504">‘“O venerable one! O king! Among the thousands of kings on the side of the Pandaveyas, there was not a single one who was capable of glancing at him. O king! The sole exception was the immensely strong Ghatotkacha, Indra among the rakshasas. He possessed terrible valour and strength. Enraged, he looked like Vaivasvata.<a id="calibre_link-2250" href="#calibre_link-1602" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">234</sup></a> Fire was generated from his angry eyes. O king! They were like flaming drops of oil in giant torches. He struck one palm with another palm. He gnashed his lower lips. He ascended his chariot, generated again through maya. It was yoked to mounts that were actually asses. But they looked like elephants and had the faces of pishachas. He angrily instructed his charioteer, ‘Take me to the son of a suta.’ The supreme of rathas advanced on a chariot that was terrible in form. O lord of the earth! There was again a duel with the son of a suta. The rakshasa was again enraged. He hurled a vajra towards the son of a suta. That vajra was extremely terrible and possessed eight wheels. It had been constructed by Rudra. As it descended, Karna placed his bow on his chariot and seized it. He hurled it back. But he<a id="calibre_link-2251" href="#calibre_link-1603" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">235</sup></a> descended from <a id="calibre_link-3505" class="calibre2"></a>his chariot.

It then shattered the earth and entered, astounding the gods who were there. Karna had descended and had seized the great vajra, which had been created by a god. All the beings and gods applauded this. Having performed this deed in the battle, Karna again ascended his chariot. The son of a suta, the scorcher of enemies, released iron arrows. O granter of honours! I do not think that there is anyone among all the beings who can perform the terrible deed accomplished by Karna in the battle there. He<a id="calibre_link-2253" href="#calibre_link-1605" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">237</sup></a> was struck by those iron arrows, which were like rain pouring down on a mountain. He possessed the form of a city of the gandharvas and disappeared again. He was a scorcher of enemies and was great in the use of maya. Using his maya and his dexterity, he destroyed all those divine weapons. The weapons were destroyed by the maya of the rakshasa. However, without any fear, Karna continued to fight with the rakshasa.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3506">‘“O great king! Bhimasena’s immensely strong son became angry. He divided himself into many different forms and frightened the kings.

He<a id="calibre_link-2254" href="#calibre_link-1606" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">238</sup></a> was himself struck with the sharp arrows released by Karna. As large as a king of mountains, he disappeared from the spot. The rakshasas, pishachas, yatudhanas, leopards and wolves advanced from all the directions, wishing to devour Karna. They uttered fierce howls, so as to terrify him. They wielded many terrible weapons. Karna pierced each of them with swift arrows that drank up their blood. He used a divine weapon to destroy the maya of the rakshasa. He killed his horses with straight-tufted arrows. While the rakshasa looked on, they were shattered and their limbs were mangled. Their backs were broken by the arrows and they fell down on the ground. When the maya was destroyed, Hidimba’s son told <a id="calibre_link-3507" class="calibre2"></a>Karna Vaikartana, ‘I will bring about your death soon.’ Having said this, he disappeared.”’</p>

With a large army, he approached Suyodhana. He was surrounded by thousands of rakshasas with distorted forms. They had many different forms. The brave one remembered his earlier enmity. Baka, his valiant relative who ate brahmanas, had been killed. So had the immensely energetic Kirmira, and his friend, Hidimba. He had waited for a long time, remembering this earlier enmity. Knowing that a fight was raging in the night, he wished to kill Bhima.<a id="calibre_link-2255" href="#calibre_link-1607" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">239</sup></a> He was as crazy as an elephant and as angry as a serpent. Desiring to fight, he spoke these words to Duryodhana. ‘O great king! Know that the rakshasas Hidimba, Baka and Kirmira were killed by Bhima. They were my relatives. He touched the maiden Hidimba in earlier times, disregarding us and all the other rakshasas. O king! I am here to kill him and his followers, with the horses, chariots and elephants. I have arrived so that I can myself kill Hidimba’s son and all his advisers. I will kill all the sons of Kunti, with Vasudeva at the forefront, and devour them, with all their followers. Restrain all your soldiers. We will fight with the Pandavas.’ On hearing his words, Duryodhana was delighted. Surrounded by his brothers, he showed him honours and spoke these words. ‘We will fight with the enemy, with you and your followers at the forefront. With the enmity in their minds, my soldiers cannot remain neutral.’ The bull among the rakshasas told the king that this was acceptable.</p>

The giant bow was like his. It was firm and more powerful. The arrows were like his, as long as axles. They were gold-tufted and sharpened on stone. The mighty-armed one was just as brave as Ghatotkacha. The blazing standard was like his, like the fire and the sun, and was protected by jackals and wild crows. In form, he was more handsome than Ghatotkacha and his anxious face was brilliant. His armlets blazed. His crown and garlands also blazed. He had a headdress and had girded his sword. He had clubs, catapults, maces, ploughs and bows and arrows. His skin was like that of an elephant. The chariot was as radiant as the fire, as he drove away the army of the Pandavas. He was resplendent in that battle and whirled around, like a cloud tinged with lightning in the sky. There were the foremost of kings, brave warriors among the Pandavas. They were immensely strong and possessed armour and shields. O king! When he arrived, they cheerfully fought with him in every direction.”’</p>

The kings thought that they had been born again. They welcomed and worshipped Alayudha, Indra among the rakshasas.

All of them were routed and everyone there became senseless. O great king! Your soldiers gave up all hope of Karna remaining alive. On seeing that Karna was confronting the ultimate calamity, Duryodhana summoned Alayudha, Indra among the rakshasas, and spoke these words to him. ‘Vaikartana Karna is engaged with Hidimba’s son. He is performing great deeds in the battle, deserving of someone like him. But behold. Those brave kings are being killed by Bhimasena’s son.

There was a battle between those two enraged Indras among the rakshasas. They were like two crazy elephants fighting in the forest, desiring the same she-elephant.

Alayudha, the scorcher of enemies, repeatedly showered down swift arrows that had been sharpened on stone on Kounteya. All the other rakshasas also attacked Bhimasena. Wishing to ensure the victory of your sons, they wielded many terrible weapons. The immensely strong Bhimasena was afflicted by those strong ones. He pierced each of them with five sharp arrows. Those rakshasas, born from the wombs of asses, were slaughtered by Bhima. They wailed loudly in lamentation and fled in the ten directions. On seeing that his followers had been terrorized by Bhima, the immensely strong rakshasa attacked with great force and covered him with arrows. In that encounter, Bhimsena used sharp arrows that were pointed at the tip against the rakshasa. Alayudha severed some of the arrows that were shot by Bhima in the battle.

They cast aside their clubs and again clashed against each other. They struck each other with their fists, with a sound like that of the thunder. Extremely intolerant, they struck each other with the wheels of chariots, yokes, axles, bumpers and seats. They clashed against each other and blood flowed from their wounds. They repeatedly attacked each other, like crazy and giant elephants. Hrishikesha was <a id="calibre_link-3521" class="calibre2"></a>engaged in the welfare of the Pandavas.

Kill Karna later.’ Hearing Varshneya’s words, the valiant one abandoned Karna. Ghatotkacha started to fight with the Indra among rakhasas, Baka’s brother. In the night, there was an extremely tumultuous battle between the rakshasas. Alayudha’s warriors were rakshasas, terrible in form. Those brave ones grasped their bows and arrows and descended with force. As they advanced with their weapons, maharatha Yuyudhana, Nakula and Sahadeva cut them down with sharp arrows. O king! In that encounter, Kiriti Bibhatsu shot arrows in all directions and uprooted all the bulls among the kshatriyas. O king! In that encounter, Karna drove away many kings&mdash;Dhrishtadyumna, Shikhandi and other Panchala maharathas.

That night, with signs of their victory, became extremely resplendent. The garlands of lamps were as beautiful as lightning. Bhimasena’s immensely strong son took Alayudha’s head and flung it down before Duryodhana, who was bereft of his senses. King Duryodhana saw that Alayudha had been killed.

On hearing those tumultuous sounds, the elephants trembled. O great king! Those on your side were overcome by terrible fear. On seeing that Bhimasena’s immensely strong son was engaged with Alayudha, the mighty-armed Karna had attacked the Panchalas. He drew his firm bow all the way back and releasing arrows with drooping tufts, pierced Dhrishtadyumna and Shikhandi with ten arrows each. The supreme among rathas used other iron arrows and made Yudhamanyu, Uttamouja and Satyaki tremble. O lord of men! Both on the left and on the right, all their bows could be seen, drawn into circles as they fought. There was the twang of bowstrings, the slapping of palms and the clatter of chariot wheels. During the night, these sounds were tumultuous, like that of clouds at the end of the summer. O king! The battle was beautiful, as if between clouds. The twang of bowstrings and the clatter of wheels were the roar. The bows were drawn into circles. The standards were like peaks. The torrent of arrows was like rain. Vaikartana was like a mountain that did not tremble. He had the essence of a large mountain. O Indra among men! In that battle, the scorcher of a large number of enemies repulsed that hail of arrows and it was wonderful. His sharp arrows were gold-tufted and colourful. They possessed the force of thunder. In that encounter, the great-souled one struck the enemy. Vaikartana was engaged in ensuring the welfare of your sons. The standards of some were brought down. The bodies of others were mangled by the arrows. Some lost their charioteers. Others lost their horses. Achieving this quickly, Vaikartana was resplendent.

That storm of arrows covered the sky in the battle and traversing diagonally, made it look beautiful. They were gold-tufted and flamed like the fire. It was as if the sky was covered with diverse flowers. Their power was equal and they struck each other with supreme weapons. In that battle, no one could discern that either of those brave ones was superior to the other. That encounter between the sons of the sun god and Bhima was wonderful in form. Many terrible weapons were showered down. It was as if Rahu was tormenting the sun in the sky. O king! Ghatotkacha saw that he could not get the better of Karna. The supreme among those who have knowledge of weapons then invoked a terrible weapon. With that weapon, the rakshasa first killed Karna’s horses and then the charioteer.

The sky became dark because of those arrows and all the creatures were rendered invisible. The son of a suta exhibited his dexterity and no one could discern when he affixed an arrow, when he aimed it, when he released it and when he touched the quiver with his fingers. The entire sky was covered by those arrows. From the sky, the rakshasa resorted to a terrible and fierce maya. We saw what looked like red clouds in the sky. They blazed, like the fierce flames of a fire. O Indra among Kouravas! Lightning issued from these and so did blazing meteors. Loud and fierce roars issued forth, like the sound of a thousand drums being beaten. Gold-tufted arrows rained down. There were javelins, spears, clubs, other weapons, battleaxes, swords washed in oil, axes that blazed at the edges, spikes, sparkling <a id="calibre_link-3535" class="calibre2"></a>clubs that were girded with iron, colourful bludgeons, lances that were sharp at the tip, heavy maces decorated with gold and bound in cloth and shataghnis. They showered down in every direction. Thousands of giant boulders fell down there, with thunder and lightning. There were hundreds of razor-sharp chakras. They manifested themselves, blazing like the fire. There were spears, rocks, battleaxes, javelins, vajras and extremely terrible bolts of thunder. That large and blazing shower descended. With his storm of arrows, Karna could not destroy these. Horses were struck by the arrows and fell down. Elephants were struck by the vajras and fell down. Maharathas were struck by the rocks and fell down, shrieking loudly. Using that extremely terrible shower of weapons in every direction, Ghatotkacha caused destruction. Duryodhana’s army was distressed and could be seen to roam around. As they wandered around, there were sounds of lamentation. They were being destroyed and were miserable. Because they were noble, the foremost among the brave ones did not run away.<a id="calibre_link-2276" href="#calibre_link-1628" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">260</sup></a> Nor were they distressed. However, that shower created by the rakshasa was extremely fierce and terrible. The large weapons descended. On seeing that the large army was being destroyed, a great fear arose in the hearts of your sons. Hundreds of jackals howled in extremely fierce tones. Their tongues seemed to blaze with fire. O Indra among kings! On seeing that the large numbers of rakshasas were yelling, the warriors were extremely pained. Their<a id="calibre_link-2277" href="#calibre_link-1629" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">261</sup></a> tongues and faces flamed. Their teeth were sharp. They were fierce. Their bodies were like mountains. They were in the sky, with lances in their hands. They looked like clouds that showered down rain. They<a id="calibre_link-2278" href="#calibre_link-1630" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">262</sup></a> were killed by the arrows, lances, spears, fierce clubs, flaming maces, vajras, tridents, thunder, chakras and shataghnis. They were crushed and fell down. On the soldiers of your son, they<a id="calibre_link-2279" href="#calibre_link-1631" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">263</sup></a> showered down long shafts, catapults, boulders, shataghnis and pillars made out of black iron and tied in cloth.

Their weapons were flung away. Their heads were severed. Their limbs were mangled and the brave ones began to fall down. The horses, elephants and horses<a id="calibre_link-2281" href="#calibre_link-1633" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">265</sup></a> were shattered and routed. The chariots were shattered by the boulders. Terrible in form, the <em class="calibre4">yatudhana</em>s<a id="calibre_link-2282" href="#calibre_link-1634" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">266</sup></a> released a great shower and they were created by Ghatotkacha, through the use of maya. Those who sought refuge and those who were frightened were not spared. That terrible destruction was caused by destiny and the brave ones among the Kurus were crushed. The kshatriyas were destroyed. They were shattered and violently driven away. All the Kouravas wailed. As they fled, the Kurus exclaimed, ‘For the sake of the Pandavas, Indra and the gods are killing us.’ The Bharatas were thus submerged and none of them could find a refuge. During that tumult and the carnage and destruction of the Kuru soldiers, it was impossible to distinguish between the different divisions and differentiate between who was a Kuru and who was not. That cruel destruction was terrible. All the directions seemed to be empty. O king! We could only see Karna there, submerged in that shower of weapons.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3537">‘“He covered the sky with his arrows and sought to counter the divine maya with which the rakshasa fought. He was modest and accomplished extremely difficult and noble deeds. The son of a suta was not confounded in that battle. O king! All the frightened Saindhavas and Bahlikas looked towards Karna. He was not confounded in that battle and they worshipped him, while witnessing the rakshasa’s victory. He<a id="calibre_link-2283" href="#calibre_link-1635" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">267</sup></a> created a shataghni with wheels and hurling it, killed his<a id="calibre_link-2284" href="#calibre_link-1636" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">268</sup></a> four horses at the same time. They lost their lives and sank down on their knees. They lost their teeth, eyes and tongues. With the horses killed, he<a id="calibre_link-2285" href="#calibre_link-1637" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">269</sup></a> leapt down <a id="calibre_link-3538" class="calibre2"></a>from the chariot and saw that the Kurus were being driven away. His divine weapon had been destroyed by the maya. He began to think about what should be the appropriate course of action. All the Kurus saw Karna and the terrible maya. They said, ‘O Karna! Quickly kill the rakshasa now with your spear.<a id="calibre_link-2286" href="#calibre_link-1638" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">270</sup></a> The Kurus and the sons of Dhritarashtra are being destroyed. What can Bhima and Arjuna possibly do to us? Kill the rakshasa who is destroying us in the night. We will be able to fight with the Parthas in the battle only if we escape from this terrible encounter. Therefore, kill the rakshasa, terrible in form, with the spear that Vasava has given you. O Karna! All the Kouravas are like Indra. Let these warriors not be destroyed in the night.’ O king! He saw that the army was being destroyed by the rakshasa in the night. He heard the loud lamentations of the Kouravas.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3539">‘“Karna made up his mind to use the spear. Unable to bear the assaults made in the battle, he was like an angry and intolerant lion. That supreme spear was always victorious and he decided to use it to kill him.<a id="calibre_link-2287" href="#calibre_link-1639" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">271</sup></a> O king! He had preserved it for many years, worshipping it for the sake of Phalguna. Shakra had given that supreme spear to Karna in exchange for the earrings. That spear was resplendent and flaming. It was tied with ropes and in the night, looked like Death. Flaming like a meteor, it was like Death’s sister. Vaikartana released it towards the rakshasa. That flaming weapon was released from the arm of the son of a suta. It was supreme and was capable of destroying the body of every enemy. O king! On seeing it, the rakshasa was frightened. He fled, assuming a body that was as large as the foothills of the Vindhya mountains. O Indra among kings! On seeing that spear in Karna’s hands, all the beings in the sky roared loudly. O king! Turbulent winds began to blow. Bolts of thunder began to strike. Blazing away, it reduced the rakshasa’s maya to ashes and severely penetrated his heart. Then it blazed and ascended up in the night, entering among the nakshatras.</p>
<a id="calibre_link-3540" class="calibre2"></a>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3541">‘“The brave rakshasa had fought in many colourful ways, using the weapons of gods, humans and rakshasas. His life was robbed by Shakra’s spear and uttering many fierce yells, he fell down. This was yet another wonderful and extraordinary deed that he performed for the destruction of the enemy. At that time, his heart was shattered by the spear. O king! He was as beautiful as a mountain or a cloud. The Indra among rakshasas fell down from the sky, devoid of life. With his body shattered, he fell down on the ground. As he fell down dead, Ghatotkacha made his body assume a gigantic form. With that fierce form, Bhimasena’s son, the performer of terrible deeds, performed another terrible deed. He fell down on one part of your army and fiercely crushed the Kouravas. A loud uproar arose, mixed with the sounds of drums, conch shells, kettledrums and cymbals, and roars like lions’. With the maya destroyed and the rakshasa killed, the Kouraveyas were delighted and roared in joy. Karna was honoured by the Kurus, just as Shakra was by the Maruts, after the slaying of Vritra. He<a id="calibre_link-2288" href="#calibre_link-1640" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">272</sup></a> ascended your son’s chariot and cheerfully entered the army.”’</p>

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3550">‘Sanjaya said, “On seeing that Hidimba’s son had been killed, like a shattered mountain, all the Pandavas were distressed in <a id="calibre_link-3551" class="calibre2"></a>their minds and their eyes were full of tears. However, Vasudeva was overcome with great delight. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! He roared like a lion and this pained them. He roared loudly and embraced Phalguna. Roaring loudly, he tied the horses. He danced in joy, like a tree stirred by the wind. Having embraced Partha yet again, he slapped his arms against his breast. Achyuta climbed onto the chariot and let out a fierce yell. O king! On discerning that the immensely strong Vasudeva was in a delighted frame of mind, Arjuna was miserable and spoke to him. ‘O Madhusudana! At this time of death today, you are extremely happy. The death of Hidimba’s son is a time for great sorrow. On seeing that Ghatotkacha has been killed, the soldiers are retreating. Since Hidimba’s son has been brought down, we are also extremely anxious. O Janardana! There must be a grave reason behind your delight now. O supreme among the ones who are truthful! I am asking you. Tell me the truth. O scorcher of enemies! If it is not a secret, you should tell me. O Madhusudana! Tell me why your calm has been disturbed so much today. This is like the ocean drying up, or Mount Meru moving. O Janardana! I think that this act of yours shows levity.’</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3552">‘“Vasudeva replied, ‘O Dhananjaya! I am overcome by great delight. Listen to me. I will tell you what will bring supreme satisfaction to your mind. O immensely radiant one! Because of Ghatotkacha, the spear has been used up. O Dhananjaya! Therefore, know that Karna has already been slain. Had Karna possessed the spear in his hand, no man in the world would have been able to stand before him. He would have been stationed like Kartikeya in the battle. It is through good fortune that his armour has gone. It is through good fortune that his earrings have been robbed. It is through good fortune that the invincible spear has been used up on Ghatotkacha. Had he possessed the armour and had he possessed the earrings, the powerful Karna would have been able to defeat everyone in the three worlds, even the immortals. Vasava, Kubera, Varuna, lord of the waters, and Yama would not have ventured against Karna in an encounter. Had that bull among men possessed those, you with your Gandiva and I with my <em class="calibre4">sudarshana chakra</em> would not have had the capacity to defeat him in a battle. It is for your welfare that Shakra <a id="calibre_link-3553" class="calibre2"></a>used delusion to rob him of his earrings. The conqueror of enemy cities was also robbed of his armour. It is because he sliced off the armour and the sparkling earrings and gave them to Shakra that Karna came to be known as Vaikartana.<a id="calibre_link-1642" href="#calibre_link-1762" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">1</sup></a> Karna is now like an angry snake, whose energy has been sapped through mantras. Therefore, Karna is now like a fire whose flames have been pacified. O mighty-armed one! Karna obtained a spear from the great-souled Vasava, the one that has now been used against Ghatotkacha. This was obtained in exchange for the earrings and the celestial armour. Since the time he obtained it, Vrisha has always thought that you have been killed in the battle. O unblemished one! O tiger among men! However, though that spear has now gone, I swear to you truthfully that he is incapable of being killed by anyone other than you. He is devoted to brahmanas. He is truthful. He has engaged in austerities. He is devoted to his vows. He is compassionate towards his enemies. It is for these reasons that Karna is known as Vrisha.<a id="calibre_link-1643" href="#calibre_link-1763" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">2</sup></a> He is terrible in battle. He is mighty-armed. His bow is always raised. He is like a lion in the forest, crushing the leaders of crazy herds of elephants. In the field of battle, he crushes tigers among the rathas. He is like the sun when it has attained midday and no one is capable of looking at him. O tiger among men! He has fought with all the foremost and great-souled ones on your side. His nets of arrows are like the thousand rays of the autumn sun. His incessant shower of arrows is like rain from the clouds, at the end of summer. Karna is like a cloud with divine weapons, showering down rain. However, having been deprived today of what was given to him by Shakra, he has become human. There is now an opportunity to kill him, one that the insolent one has brought about through his own insolence. He will face a hardship when the wheel of his chariot sinks. That is the time to kill him and I will signal the moment to you in advance. Jarasandha, the great-souled king of Chedi, the immensely strong Ekalavya from Nishadha&mdash;all of these <a id="calibre_link-3554" class="calibre2"></a>have been killed through my yoga, for your sake.<a id="calibre_link-1644" href="#calibre_link-1764" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">3</sup></a> Later, other Indras among rakshasas have been killed&mdash;Hidimba, Kirmira, Baka, the foremost among them, Alayudha, the destroyer of enemy soldiers, and the spirited Ghatotkacha, the performer of fierce deeds.’”’</p>

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3556">‘“Arjuna asked, ‘O Janardana! What objective of ours was served and what yoga did you use? How were Jarasandha and the other lords of the earth killed?’</p>

There is no doubt that Suyodhana would have chosen those supreme among rathas.<a id="calibre_link-1646" href="#calibre_link-1766" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">5</sup></a> They have always harboured wicked intentions towards us and would have gone to the side of the Kouravas. All of those great-souled ones were brave, skilled in the use of weapons and firm warriors. They would have protected the army of the son of Dhritarashtra like the immortals. Resorting to the son of a suta, Jarasandha, the king of Chedi and the son of Nishadha, Suyodhana would have been able to conquer the entire earth. O Dhananjaya! They were killed by me through yoga. Listen to it. Without using yoga, they could not have been defeated in a battle, not even by the gods. O Partha! Each of them was separately capable of countering the army of the gods in a battle, even if it were to be protected by the guardians of the world. Jarasandha was angered, incited by Rohini’s son.<a id="calibre_link-1647" href="#calibre_link-1767" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">6</sup></a> To kill us, he hurled a club that was red at <a id="calibre_link-3558" class="calibre2"></a>the tip.

On seeing that the club was descending, Rohini’s son wished to counter it and released the weapon known as <em class="calibre4">sthunakarna</em>.<a id="calibre_link-1649" href="#calibre_link-1769" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">8</sup></a> Countered by the force of that weapon, the club fell down on the ground. It shattered the goddess earth and made the mountains tremble. There was a terrible <em class="calibre4">rakshasi</em><a id="calibre_link-1650" href="#calibre_link-1770" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">9</sup></a> named Jara and she possessed great valour. O scorcher of enemies! She united the infant and it came to be known as Jarasandha. Two separate parts were born from the bodies of two separate mothers. Since she united them, he came to be known as Jarasandha. O Partha! That rakshasi was slain by the club and the weapon known as sthunakarna and entered the earth, together with her son and kin. O Dhananjaya! Jarasandha was deprived of the club in the great battle and while you watched, was killed by Bhimasena. O supreme among men! If the powerful Jarasandha had possessed that club in his hand, the gods, together with Indra, would not have been able to kill him in an encounter. O one for whom truth is valour! It is also for your sake that Drona adopted the disguise of a preceptor and severed Nishadha’s thumb.<a id="calibre_link-1651" href="#calibre_link-1771" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">10</sup></a> With his finger guards, the son of the Nishadha was firm in his valour. He was as resplendent as a second Rama in the forest. O Partha! Had Ekalavya possessed his thumb, the gods and the danavas, with the rakshasas and the serpents, would never have been able to defeat him in a battle. His fist was firm and he could continuously shoot, throughout the day and night. How could a mere human have looked at him? It is for your sake that I killed <a id="calibre_link-3559" class="calibre2"></a>him in the field of battle. I killed the powerful king of Chedi in your presence. He was capable of conquering all the gods and the asuras in a battle. O tiger among men! I have been born to slay him and also all the others who hate the gods, with your help, and desiring the welfare of the worlds. Hidimba, Baka and Kirmira have been brought down by Bhimasena. They were the equals of Ravana and destroyed the sacrifices of brahmanas. Similarly, Alayudha, who used maya, was slain by Hidimba’s son. And I thought of means to get Hidimba’s son killed by Karna’s spear. Had he not been killed by Karna’s spear in the great battle, I would have had to kill Ghatotkacha, Bhimasena’s son, in the future. I did not kill him earlier, because I wanted to ensure your pleasure. This rakshasa hated brahmanas and hated sacrifices. Because he caused the destruction of dharma and because he was evil in his soul, he would have had to be brought down. O unblemished one! I thought of a means through what had been given by Shakra. O Pandava! Those who are the destroyers of dharma, deserve to be killed by me. I have taken a pledge that I will establish dharma. I am always present wherever the brahman, truthfulness, self-control, purity, dharma, humility, prosperity, fortitude and forgiveness exist. You should not have any anxiety about Karna Vaikartana. I will tell you the means so that you can destroy him. In the battle, Suyodhana will also be killed by Vrikodara. O Pandava! I will tell you about the means whereby that death can be ensured. There is a tumultuous uproar that has arisen in the direction of the enemy’s army. Your soldiers are fleeing in the ten directions. Having attained their objective, the Kouravas are destroying your army. Drona, supreme among strikers, is scorching our soldiers.’”’</p>

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3561">‘Dhritarashtra said, “The son of the suta possessed a spear that could only be used to kill one person. Why did he not forget everyone else and hurl it at Partha? Had he been slain, all the Pandavas <a id="calibre_link-3562" class="calibre2"></a>and Srinjayas would have been killed too. Had that brave one alone been killed, why should victory in the battle not have been ours? He is great in his vows and does not retreat when he is challenged. The son of the suta should have challenged Phalguna himself. O Sanjaya! Tell me. Why did Vrisha not challenge Phalguna to a duel and kill him with what he had obtained from Shakra? There is no doubt that my son lacks both intelligence and advisers. How can he obtain victory if he is frustrated by the enemy in every way? That spear was a supreme weapon and our victory depended on it. Vasudeva has ensured that the spear was wasted on Ghatotkacha. This is like a powerful person snatching a <em class="calibre4">bilva</em> fruit from the hands of someone with a withered arm. In that fashion, because of Ghatotkacha, that infallible spear has been rendered fallible. In a fight between a boar and a dog, when either one dies, the hunter gains.<a id="calibre_link-1652" href="#calibre_link-1772" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">11</sup></a> O learned one! Like that, I think that Vasudeva has gained from the battle between Karna and Hidimba’s son. Had Ghatokacha slain Karna, it would have been a supreme gain for the Pandavas. And had Vaikartana slain him, it would still have been a gain, because the spear would have been rendered useless. The wisest among wise ones thought in this way about the encounter between Ghatotkacha and the son of a suta. Though Vasudeva, lion among men, is not fighting in this battle, he is engaged in ensuring the welfare of the Pandavas.”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3563">‘Sanjaya said, “O king! The slayer of Madhu knew what Karna desired to do. The immensely intelligent Janardana instructed the immensely valorous Ghatotkacha, lord of the rakshasas, to engage in that duel. The intention was to make the infallible weapon useless. O king! All this happened because of your evil policy. O extender of the Kuru lineage! We would certainly have been successful, had not Krishna protected Partha from maharatha Karna. O Dhritarashtra! In the battle, with his horses, standard and chariot, Partha would have fallen down on the ground, but for Janardana, the lord and master of all yoga. O king! He has been protected in many different ways. Protected by Krishna, Partha has advanced against the enemy and obtained victory. It was indeed Krishna who protected Partha from <a id="calibre_link-3564" class="calibre2"></a>that infallible weapon. Kounteya would have been swiftly destroyed by the spear, like a tree by thunder.”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3565">‘Dhritarashtra said, “My son is proud of his wisdom. But he quarrels and has evil advisers. He has thus overlooked the means for killing Jaya.<a id="calibre_link-1653" href="#calibre_link-1773" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">12</sup></a> O son of Gavalgana! Why did you also forget that objective? O immensely intelligent one! Why did you not remind him about it?”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3566">‘Sanjaya replied, “Night after night, this used to be the topic of discussion between Duryodhana, Shakuni, Duhshasana and me. ‘O Karna! Tomorrow, abandon all the other soldiers and kill Dhananjaya. We will then enjoy the Pandus and the Panchalas, as if they are our slaves. Or, after Partha has been killed, if Varshneya appoints one of the other sons of Pandu as the warrior, we will bring down Krishna. Krishna is the root of the sons of Pandu. Partha is the trunk. The Parthas<a id="calibre_link-1654" href="#calibre_link-1774" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">13</sup></a> are the branches. The Panchalas can be thought of as leaves. Krishna is the refuge of the Pandavas. Krishna is the strength. Krishna is the protector. They are devoted to Krishna, like the stellar bodies to the moon. O son of a suta! Therefore, forget the leaves, branches and trunk. Bring down Krishna, who has always been the root of the Pandava in every way.’<a id="calibre_link-1655" href="#calibre_link-1775" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">14</sup></a> O king! Had Dasharha Krishna, the descendant of the Yadava lineage, been slain, there is no doubt that this entire earth would have come under your control. O Indra among kings! Had the great-souled one, loved by the Yadu and Pandava lineages, been killed and made to lie down on the ground, there is no doubt that the earth, with its mountains, oceans and forests, would have come under your control. Every morning, we arose with that resolution about the lord of the thirty gods, the immeasurable Hrishikesha. But at the time of the battle, we forgot about it. Keshava has always protected Kounteya Arjuna. In the battle, that is the reason he didn’t allow him to be stationed before the son of the suta. Achyuta stationed other supreme rathas there. O lord! He acted so that the infallible spear might become fallible. The <a id="calibre_link-3567" class="calibre2"></a>mighty-armed Satyaki, tiger among rathas, for whom truth was his valour, had asked Krishna about maharatha Karna. ‘This has been the infinitely valorous Karna’s resolution.

Accordingly, Karna gave his pledge. The thought of killing the wielder of Gandiva was always in Karna’s heart. O foremost among warriors! But I confused Radheya. That is the reason he did not release the spear at Pandava, the one with the white horses. O Yuyutsu! It would have brought about Phalguna’s death. O supreme among warriors! I could not sleep and there was no happiness in my mind. O bull among the Shini lineage! Then I saw that it had been rendered unsuccessful by Ghatotkacha. Today, I see that Dhananjaya has been rescued from the jaws of death. In a battle, the protection of my father, my mother, you, my brothers and my life is not as important as that of Bibhatsu. O Satvata! If there is anything that is more precious than the kingdom of the three worlds, I do not desire it without Partha Dhananjaya. O Yuyudhana! I am extremely delighted today. I can see that Partha Dhananjaya has returned from the dead. It is because of this that I sent the rakshasa to fight with Karna. No one else was capable of countering Karna during this battle in the night.’”</p>

You have always known that the spear could only kill a single person in the battle. It was incapable of being countered even by the gods, with Vasava. Why did Karna not use it in the battle earlier? O Sanjaya! Why did he not release it at Devaki’s son or Phalguna?”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3573">‘Sanjaya replied, “O lord of the earth! O best of those in the Kuru lineage! Returning from the battle, all of us used to converse about this in the night. We always said, ‘O Karna! O Karna! When it is morning tomorrow, hurl the spear at Keshava or Arjuna.’ O king! This was destiny. When it became morning, the intelligence of Karna and the other warriors was destroyed. I think that destiny is supreme. Though he had it in his hands, in the battle, Karna did not use it to kill Partha or Krishna, the son of Devaki. That spear was in his hand, arising like the night of destruction. However, his intelligence was destroyed by destiny and Karna did not release it. O lord! He was confounded by the delusion of destiny and did not use it to kill Krishna, the son of Devaki, or Partha, the equal of Shakra.”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3574">‘Dhritarashtra said, “You have been slain through destiny and through Keshava’s intelligence. What was given by Vasava has gone, wasted on Ghatotkacha, who was like a blade of grass. Because of this undesirable act, Karna, my sons and all the other kings have been conveyed to Vaivasvata’s eternal abode. Tell me about how the battle continued thereafter between the Kurus and the Pandavas, after Hidimba’s son had been killed. How did those strikers attack Drona’s battle formation? What did the Srinjayas and the Panchalas do in the battle? After the death of Somadatta’s son and Saindhava, Drona must have become intolerant and prepared to give up his own life. He must have immersed himself in the army. He must have been like a yawning tiger or Death with a gaping mouth. As Drona advanced, how did the Pandus and Srinjayas counter him? O son! What did <a id="calibre_link-3575" class="calibre2"></a>Drona’s son, Karna and Kripa do in that battle? With Duryodhana at the forefront, how did they protect the preceptor? Savyasachi and Vrikodara wished to kill Bharadvaja’s son in that battle. How did those on my side envelop them with arrows? O Sanjaya! Tell me that. After the death of the king of Sindhu and after the death of Ghatotkacha, they must have been intolerant and extremely angry. How did the battle rage during the night?”</p>

With the death of Hidimba’s son, I have become overcome by great confusion.’ Having been instructed, Bhima sat down on his own chariot. The king’s face was full of tears and he sighed repeatedly. On witnessing Karna’s valour, he was overcome by great lassitude. On seeing that he was distressed, Krishna spoke these words to him. ‘O Kounteya! Do not be miserable. This is not deserving of you. O foremost among the Bharata lineage! Like an ordinary man, you should not yield to impotence. O king! Arise and fight. O lord! Bear the heavy burden. If you yield to impotence, there will be an uncertainty about victory.’</p>

You know that dharma is the supreme objective. The fruits of killing a brahmana devolve on those who do not acknowledge a service. O Janardana! When we were in the forest, Hidimba’s great-souled son, though he was but a child, performed many services for us. O Krishna!

He lived with us, until <a id="calibre_link-3578" class="calibre2"></a>Dhananjaya returned. When we journeyed to Gandhamadana, he saved us from many hardships.

For my sake, the great-souled one performed diverse difficult deeds in the battle. O Janardana! I bear a natural affection towards Sahadeva. But my affection towards Ghatotkacha, Indra among the rakshasas, is twice that. O mighty-armed one! He was devoted to me. I loved him and he loved me. O Varshneya! Because of that, I am tormented by sorrow and overcome with lassitude. O Varshneya! Behold. The soldiers are being driven away by the Kouravas. Behold! Maharatha Drona and Karna are making great efforts in the battle. Behold! In the night, the Pandava soldiers are being crushed. It is as if two crazy elephants are demolishing a large forest of reeds. O Madhava! The Kouravas are showing no regard for the strength of Bhimasena’s arms, or the colourful weapons and valour that Partha possesses. On seeing that the rakshasa has been killed in the encounter, Drona, Karna and King Suyodhana are roaring with delight in the battle. O Janardana! When we are alive, and so are you, how could Hidimba’s son have encountered his death in the clash with the son of a suta? O Krishna! While all of us looked on, and so did Savyasachi, he<a id="calibre_link-1663" href="#calibre_link-1783" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">22</sup></a> blunted us and killed Bhimasena’s son, the immensely strong rakshasa. O Krishna! When Abhimanyu was killed in the battle by the evil-souled sons of Dhritarashtra, maharatha Savyasachi wasn’t present there. The evil-souled Saindhava barred all of us. Drona and his son became the instruments of that act. The preceptor himself told Karna about the means whereby he<a id="calibre_link-1664" href="#calibre_link-1784" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">23</sup></a> might be killed. When he was fighting with the sword, it was he<a id="calibre_link-1665" href="#calibre_link-1785" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">24</sup></a> who severed that sword into two. When he was fighting, Kritavarma cruelly and violently killed his horses and his two parshni charioteers. The other great archers brought down Subhadra’s son in the battle. O Krishna! O best of the Yadava lineage! It was only for a small reason that the wielder of Gandiva killed <a id="calibre_link-3579" class="calibre2"></a>Saindhava.<a id="calibre_link-1666" href="#calibre_link-1786" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">25</sup></a> This did not bring me pleasure. If Pandava wished to kill the enemy in accordance with what was fair, in my view, he should have killed Drona and Karna first. O bull among the Bharata lineage! Those two are the source of our hardships. Having resorted to those two, Suyodhana has been confident against the enemy in the battle. When Drona and the son of a suta, with his followers, should have been killed, the mighty-armed one killed Saindhava, whose connection was distant. It is certainly my task to chastise the son of a suta. O brave one! Therefore, I will myself kill Karna now. The mighty-armed Bhimasena is engaged with Drona’s formation.’ Having said this, Yudhishthira advanced, quickly and violently. He stretched his great bow and blew fiercely on his conch shell.</p>

He was surrounded by one thousand chariots, three hundred elephants, five thousand horses and three thousand Prabhadrakas. Drums were beaten and the armoured ones blew on their conch shells.

He wishes to kill the son of a suta. One should not depend on him for this.’ Having said this, Hrishikesha swiftly urged the steeds. The king was already far ahead and Janardana followed him.

On seeing that Yudhishthira, Dharma’s son, was advancing, Vyasa approached and said, ‘Though he has clashed against Karna in the battle, it is through good fortune that Phalguna is still alive. He preserved the spear, wishing to kill Savyasachi. O bull among the Bharata lineage! It is good fortune that Jishnu did not engage in a duel with him.

O supreme among the Bharata lineage! That would have led to a terrible calamity. O one who grants honours! It is good fortune that the rakshasa has been killed in the battle by the son of a suta. The rakshasa was killed by destiny. What was given by Vasava was only an instrument. O best of the Bharata lineage! Do not be angry. You should not have any sorrow in your mind.

Drona was supreme among the wielders of weapons. When the Pandavas violently advanced, making every effort in the battle, he received them. When the Pandavas angrily attacked, King Duryodhana wished to ensure that Drona remained alive and made efforts to counter them.

Your soldiers, and those of the enemy, no longer possessed any more weapons or arrows. Because they were modest, they passed the time there, following their own dharma. They did not abandon their own divisions. But other people were blind with sleep. They discarded their weapons and lay down. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! Some lay down on the backs of elephants, others on chariots, still others on the backs of horses. Some kings were blind with sleep and lost all sense of movement. In that battle, other warriors seized the chance to send them to Yama’s eternal abode. In their sleep and dreaming and unconscious, others killed those on their own side, as well as the enemy.

There were horses with golden harnesses, their manes intertwined with their reins. They stamped the level ground with their hooves and made it uneven. O Indra among kings! Everyone there slept, with his mount. Without speaking, the armies slept there and it looked like a wonderful picture drawn by a skilled painter. The kshatriyas were young and adorned in earrings.

Accomplish that pledge now and make your words come true. This Pandava, your worst enemy, is stationed in front of you. Follow the dharma of a kshatriya.

He placed himself to the left of the great archers, Drona and Karna.<a id="calibre_link-1690" href="#calibre_link-1810" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">49</sup></a> Discerning Krishna’s intention and on seeing that he<a id="calibre_link-1691" href="#calibre_link-1811" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">50</sup></a> was stationed at the front, the destroyer of enemy cities, Bhimasena, approached and spoke these words.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3600">‘“Bhimasena said, ‘O Arjuna! O Bibhatsu! O Arjuna! Listen to the words that I am telling you. The time for which kshatriya ladies bear sons has now arrived. At this time, you must strive for what is best. If you do not act accordingly, you will perform a cruel deed. You must resort to your valour and pay the debts to truth, prosperity, dharma and fame. O best of warriors! Penetrate this division and keep that one to your left.’”<a id="calibre_link-1692" href="#calibre_link-1812" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">51</sup></a></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3601">‘Sanjaya said, “Thus urged by Bhima and Keshava, Savyasachi passed over Karna and Drona and attacked the army from all sides. Bulls among kshatriyas placed themselves at the forefront and were scorched. Those bulls among kshatriyas were brave. They resorted to their valour. But none of them were capable of resisting that raging conflagration. Duryodhana, Karna and Shakuni Soubala showered down storms of arrows on Dhananjaya, Kunti’s son. O Indra among kings! However, he was supreme among those who <a id="calibre_link-3602" class="calibre2"></a>possessed knowledge of weapons. With his shower of arrows, he countered them and rendered all their weapons unsuccessful. Displaying the dexterity of his hands, Dhananjaya countered all those weapons with his own weapons. He pierced each of them with ten sharp arrows. A dust arose and the shower of arrows was like rain. In that darkness, a great and tumultuous sound arose. The sky, the earth and the directions could no longer be distinguished. Covered in darkness, the soldiers were confused and all of them seemed to be blind. O king! We could no longer distinguish each other, friend or foe. The kings continued to fight, on the basis of guessing. O king! As they clashed against each other, rathas lost their chariots. They were submerged in a mass of hair, armour and arms. Horses were slain. Charioteers were killed. The rathas lost all enterprise. When they were alive, they were seen to be afflicted by fear. Deprived of their lives, horses and their riders were seen to lie down against slain elephants that were like mountains.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3603">‘“Drona abandoned that field of battle and moved towards the northern direction. He was stationed in that battle, like a fire without smoke. O lord of the earth! On seeing him stationed there, in the forefront of the battle, the Pandava soldiers lost their peace of mind and trembled. He dazzled in his resplendence, flaming in his energy. O venerable one! On seeing Drona, they abandoned their weapons and were rendered immobile. He challenged the enemy soldiers, like an elephant with a shattered temple. They lost hope of defeating him, like the danavas against Vasava. Some lost all their initiative. Other spirited ones became angry. Others were astounded. And still others were filled with intolerance. Some kings rubbed one hand against the other. Others lost their senses because of anger and bit their lower lips. Some whirled their weapons. Others slapped their arms. There were others who possessed great energy and were ready to give up their lives. They attacked Drona. In particular, the Panchalas were afflicted by Drona’s arrows. O Indra among kings! Though they were in severe pain, they continued to try in that battle. In that encounter, Virata and Drupada advanced against Drona, as the one who was invincible in battle was roaming around in the field of battle. O lord of the earth! Three of Drupada’s grandsons and the great archers <a id="calibre_link-3604" class="calibre2"></a>among the Chedis advanced to fight against Drona. With three sharp arrows, Drona robbed the three of Drupada’s grandsons of their lives. Slain, they fell down on the ground. In that encounter, Drona then defeated the Chedis, the Kekayas, the Srinjayas and the Matsyas. Bharadvaja’s maharatha son defeated all of them. O great king! In that battle, Drupada became angry and countered Drona with a shower of arrows and so did Virata. However, Drona, the scorcher of enemies, used a couple of yellow-hued and broad-headed arrows. With these, he dispatched Drupada and Virata to Vaisvasvata’s<a id="calibre_link-1693" href="#calibre_link-1813" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">52</sup></a> eternal abode. Virata and Drupada were slain and so were the Kekayas, the Chedis, the Matsyas and the Panchalas. Three of Drupada’s brave grandsons were also killed.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3605">‘“On witnessing Drona’s deeds, the great-minded Dhrishtadyumna took a pledge in the midst of those rathas, having become overcome with anger and sorrow. ‘Let the fruits of my sacrifices and all my kshatriya and brahmana qualities be destroyed, if Drona escapes from me today, as long as Drona does not retreat from the battle.’ He thus took an oath in the midst of all the archers. With his soldiers, Panchala, the destroyer of enemy heroes, advanced against Drona. The Panchalas attacked Drona from one side and the Pandavas from the other. Duryodhana, Karna, Shakuni Soubala and the other foremost brothers<a id="calibre_link-1694" href="#calibre_link-1814" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">53</sup></a> protected Drona in the battle. When Drona was thus protected by those great-souled ones in the battle, the Panchalas made efforts, but were incapable of glancing at him. O venerable one! At this, Bhimasena became angry with Dhrishtadyumna. O bull among men! The eloquent one wounded him with these fierce words. ‘You have been born in the lineage of Drupada. You are supreme among those who have knowledge of all weapons. You are honoured as a kshatriya. How can such a person merely look on, when his enemy is stationed before him? Having seen his father killed, what man leaves the task unfinished, especially when he has taken a pledge in the midst of the assembly of kings? With his bow and arrows as kindling, Drona is like a fire, which is growing because <a id="calibre_link-3606" class="calibre2"></a>of his energy. He is consuming the kshatriyas with his energy. He will soon destroy all the Pandava soldiers. All of you remain here as spectators and behold my deeds, as I myself advance against Drona.’ Having said this, Vrikodara angrily penetrated Drona’s army. He firmly drew his bow back all the way and routed your army. Panchala Dhrishtadyumna also penetrated that large army. A battle commenced with Drona and a great and tumultuous sound arose. A battle like that has not been seen earlier, nor heard of. O king! When the sun arose, the great battle commenced. O venerable one! Large numbers of chariots were seen to be engaged. Living beings were slain and their bodies were strewn around. Others wished to go elsewhere, but were attacked along the way. There were those who fled and were struck on their backs. Others were struck on their sides. That extremely terrible engagement and fight continued. In a short while, it became morning and the sun arose.”’</p>

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3608">‘Sanjaya said, “O great king! It was morning and with its one thousand rays, the sun arose. The one with the thousand rays arose and its complexion was like that of molten gold. In the forefront of the battle, the armoured ones worshipped it and as the world became illuminated, the battle commenced again. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! Those who were engaged with each other earlier, continued to fight with each other after the sun arose. Rathas fought with horse riders, horse riders with elephant riders, infantry with elephants, horses clashed with horses and foot soldiers with foot soldiers. In that battle, the warriors attacked, sometimes together and sometimes separately. They were exhausted because of the deeds they had performed during the night. The sun’s energy made them hungry and thirsty. Many of them lost all sensation in their limbs. There was the sound of conch shells, drums and battle drums, together with the trumpeting of elephants. There was the sound of bows being <a id="calibre_link-3609" class="calibre2"></a>stretched and drawn. O king! O bull among the Bharata lineage! The sound that was generated seemed to touch the sky.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3610">‘“The foot soldiers fled and weapons descended. The horses neighed and the chariots rattled. There were angry roars and there was a great and tumultuous sound. That loud and fierce noise spread and reached up into the sky. As warriors were brought down, there were woes of lamentation. That great and piteous wail could be heard all over the ground. Foot soldiers, horses, chariots and elephants fell down, or were falling down. All the battle formations clashed against each other and there was a general melee. Some killed those on their own side, as well as that of the enemy. Some engaged with their own side. Others engaged with the enemy. Swords could be seen, hurled from the brave arms of warriors, or from the backs of elephants. They looked like garments amassed for washing. As they were raised up in the arms of brave warriors, the swords made a sound like that of garments being beaten at the time of washing. There were daggers,<a id="calibre_link-1695" href="#calibre_link-1815" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">54</sup></a> swords, lances and battleaxes. They were used in that clash and there was a great and fearful sound. The brave ones created a river out of the blood of elephants and horses and the bodies of men flowed along. It was full of fish in the form of weapons. The flesh and blood was the mire. The lamentations were the roar and the flags and garments were the foam. It flowed along to the world of the hereafter. They were afflicted by arrows and spears. They were exhausted from the night. They were confused and senseless. All their limbs were motionless. The elephants and horses were weak. The faces of the brave ones were dry, though their heads were decorated with beautiful earrings. Here and there, diverse implements of war could be seen. The place was full of carnivorous beings and those who were dead and dying. There was no space for the chariots or the warriors to pass. The wheels of chariots got stuck and the horses which bore them depended on their spirits. But some of them were extremely tired. The horses trembled and were afflicted by the arrows, though they were spirited and born in noble lineages, possessing strength and sizes like those of elephants. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! At <a id="calibre_link-3611" class="calibre2"></a>that time, everyone was distracted and agitated. With the exception of Drona and Arjuna, both armies were overtaken by fright. These two became the refuges of the distressed ones on their respective sides. Others<a id="calibre_link-1696" href="#calibre_link-1816" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">55</sup></a> encountered them and departed for Vaivasvata’s eternal abode. The entire large army of the Kouravas was shattered. The Panchalas gathered together and one could not distinguish one from the other. That fierce carnage increased the fear of those who were cowards. O king! There was a great destruction and the earth was like a cremation ground. Karna, Drona, Arjuna, Yudhishthira, Bhimasena, the twins, Panchala, Satyaki, Duhshasana, Drona’s son, Duryodhana, Soubala, Kripa, the king of Madra, Kritavarma, the others, one’s own self, the earth or the directions, could not be seen there. O king! When the soldiers clashed, everything was covered in dust. A fierce and terrible cloud of dust arose. We thought that a second night had arrived there. One could not distinguish the Kouraveyas from the Panchalas and the Pandavas. The directions, the sky, heaven and earth and plain and uneven terrain could not be distinguished. In that battle, desiring victory, men brought down others through the touch of the hand, without differentiating the enemy from those on one’s own side. However, a wind arose and dispelled the dust, which was also pacified through the sprinkling of blood. The dust that arose from the earth was pacified and was soon driven away by the wind. With blood flowing from their wounded limbs, the elephants, horses, warriors, rathas and foot soldiers there looked as beautiful as a grove of <em class="calibre4">parijata</em><a id="calibre_link-1697" href="#calibre_link-1817" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">56</sup></a> blossoms.</p>

Duryodhana and his brother clashed against the twins, Vrikodara against Radheya and Bharadvaja’s son against Arjuna. Everyone else looked on at that great and terrible wonder. It was a fierce and superhuman encounter between those bulls among rathas. Their chariots traversed wonderful paths. The chariots executed diverse motions. Those warriors were colourful in fighting and all the warriors witnessed <a id="calibre_link-3613" class="calibre2"></a>that wonderful battle. They<a id="calibre_link-1698" href="#calibre_link-1818" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">57</sup></a> were brave and made endeavours to vanquish each other. They showered down arrows, like a cloud at the end of summer. Those bulls among men were stationed on chariots that were as radiant as the sun. They were as beautiful as a mass of clouds during autumn. The great archers challenged each other. They made efforts in wielding their bows. They attacked each other, like crazy bull elephants.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3614">‘“It is true that one does not discard one’s body until the time has come, since those maharathas were not simultaneously killed in that battle. Arms and feet were severed and so were heads with beautiful earrings.<a id="calibre_link-1699" href="#calibre_link-1819" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">58</sup></a> There were hollow arrows and razor-sharp arrows, iron arrows, nails, lances and javelins and many other kinds of sharp and supreme weapons. There was diverse and colourful armour for the body. Many chariots were shattered. Many elephants and horses were slain. With the standards brought down, the chariots looked like empty cities. Bereft of men, the frightened horses dragged the chariots here and there, with a speed like that of the wind. There were brave warriors with ornaments, whisks, mail and standards. They were brought down. There were umbrellas, ornaments, garments and fragrant garlands. There were necklaces, crowns, diadems, headdresses and large numbers of bells. There were gems on the breasts and jewels worn on golden headgear. With these beautiful objects scattered around, the place looked like the sky, adorned by a large number of stars.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3615">‘“Duryodhana was intolerant and angry. He clashed against Nakula, who was also intolerant and angry.

In that battle, he was struck on his right flank by his cousin brother<a id="calibre_link-1700" href="#calibre_link-1820" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">59</sup></a> and became intolerant. Thus angered, he also <a id="calibre_link-3616" class="calibre2"></a>struck back on the right flank.

However, he<a id="calibre_link-1701" href="#calibre_link-1821" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">60</sup></a> repulsed all these and afflicted him with his net of arrows.

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3618">‘Sanjaya said, “Duhshasana angrily attacked Sahadeva. The terrible force of his chariot made the earth tremble. However, on seeing him advance, Madri’s son, the destroyer of enemies, swiftly severed the helmeted head of his charioteer. Sahadeva performed this act with such great speed that Duhshasana and none of the soldiers noticed that the charioteer’s head had been cut off. Without the reins being controlled by anyone, the horses ran around as they willed. At this, Duhshasana got to know that the charioteer had been killed. He<a id="calibre_link-1702" href="#calibre_link-1822" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">61</sup></a> was skilled in the handling of horses and grasping the reins of the horses himself, fought colourfully, with dexterity and skill. He was foremost among rathas and in that encounter, this deed of his was applauded, by those on his own side, as well as by the enemy. With the charioteer slain, he was still astride the chariot and roamed around without any fear. Sahadeva pierced those horses with sharp arrows and afflicted by those arrows, they swiftly ran away in different directions. To grasp the reins, he<a id="calibre_link-1703" href="#calibre_link-1823" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">62</sup></a> had to cast aside his bow. Then he took up the bow to use it, casting aside the reins. Seizing the opportunity, Madri’s son covered him with arrows.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3619">‘“To protect your son, Karna rushed there. At this, Vrikodara drew his bow back up to his ears and carefully piercing Karna in the <a id="calibre_link-3620" class="calibre2"></a>arms and in the chest with three broad-headed arrows, roared. Karna stopped,<a id="calibre_link-1704" href="#calibre_link-1824" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">63</sup></a> like a snake that has been struck by a staff. A tumultuous encounter commenced between Bhima and Radheya there. They were as angry as bulls and dilated their eyes in rage. They struck each other with great force and attacked in rage. They found great delight in fighting and were very close to each other. They were so close to each other that they could not shoot showers of arrows. The duel continued with clubs. O king! Bhimasena used his club to swiftly shatter the pole of Karna’s chariot and it was extraordinary. The valiant Radheya picked up a club and hurled it towards Bhima’s chariot, but he<a id="calibre_link-1705" href="#calibre_link-1825" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">64</sup></a> shattered the club with his own club. Bhima again picked up a heavy club and hurled it towards Adhiratha’s son. Exercising great care, Karna used ten gold-tufted arrows to strike it. He struck it with more arrows and sped it back towards Bhima. It descended and brought down Bhima’s giant standard. Struck by that club, his charioteer also lost his senses. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! He<a id="calibre_link-1706" href="#calibre_link-1826" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">65</sup></a> was senseless with anger and shot eight arrows at Karna, striking his standard, his bow and his quiver. Radheya used his arrows to swiftly kill his horses, with complexions like those of bears, and his two parshni charioteers. When his chariot faced this difficulty, Bhima climbed onto Nakula’s chariot. That scorcher of enemies was like a lion leaping onto the peak of a mountain.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3621">‘“Meanwhile, maharatha Drona and Arjuna fought in wonderful ways. O Indra among kings! They were preceptor and student and warriors who were skilled in the use of weapons. They were dexterous and firm in aim and in that encounter, their chariots roamed around. They confounded the eyes and the minds of men. All the warriors, on our side and on theirs, desisted, to watch the encounter between the preceptor and the student, the likes of which had not been seen earlier. In the midst of those soldiers, those two brave ones executed wonderful motions of the chariot, wishing to place each other on the right.<a id="calibre_link-1707" href="#calibre_link-1827" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">66</sup></a> <a id="calibre_link-3622" class="calibre2"></a>The warriors witnessed their prowess and were struck with supreme wonder. There was a great battle between Drona and Pandava. O great king! It was like that between two hawks in the sky, fighting over a piece of meat. Whenever Drona tried to do something to defeat Kunti’s son, he was swiftly nullified by the striving Pandava. Drona could not establish his superiority over Pandava in any way. The one who was skilled about the motions of weapons then invoked special weapons&mdash;aindra, <em class="calibre4">pashupata</em>, tvashtra, vayavya and varuna.<a id="calibre_link-1708" href="#calibre_link-1828" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">67</sup></a> However, as soon as these were released from Drona’s bow, Dhananjaya destroyed them. When his weapons were duly destroyed by Pandava’s weapons, Drona released supreme and divine weapons towards Partha. However, every weapon that was invoked with a desire to vanquish Partha, was duly destroyed by Arjuna with another weapon. When those weapons, including the divine ones, were duly destroyed by Arjuna, Drona honoured Arjuna in his mind. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! Since, in the midst of everyone, his student had countered him, he considered himself to be better than all those who knew about weapons on earth. Partha repulsed him in the midst of those great-souled ones. Pleased at Arjuna’s enterprise, he countered him in turn. There were gods, thousands of gandharvas, rishis and masses of siddhas in the sky, assembled as spectators. There were also many apsaras, yakshas and rakshasas. The sky was beautiful, as if with a mass of clouds. An invisible voice was repeatedly heard in the firmament. It praised Drona and great-souled Partha. ‘The ten directions seem to be flaming, because of the weapons that have been released. It is evident that this is not a battle involving a man, an asura, a rakshasa, a god or a gandharva. There is no doubt this is one with the qualities of the brahman. This is wonderful and extraordinary. We have not seen, or heard of, something like this. The preceptor seems to prevail over Pandava. Then Pandava seems to prevail over Drona. No one is capable of distinguishing between the weapons they are using. If Rudra divides himself into two and those two parts fight with each other, one may <a id="calibre_link-3623" class="calibre2"></a>be able to find a parallel, not otherwise. The preceptor possesses knowledge. Pandava possesses knowledge and yoga. The preceptor possesses valour. Pandava possesses strength and valour. No enemy is capable of withstanding either of these great archers in battle. If they so wish, they can destroy the entire world, with the immortals.’ O great king! On beholding those bulls among men, all the visible and invisible beings spoke such words.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3624">‘“The immensely intelligent Drona invoked brahmastra. It scorched Partha and all the invisible beings. The earth, with all its mountains and trees, began to tremble. Turbulent winds began to blow and the oceans were agitated. When the great-souled one invoked that weapon, there was terror among the Kuru and Pandava soldiers and all the beings and a great uproar arose. O Indra among kings! However, Partha was not frightened. He countered that weapon with his own brahmastra and everything became peaceful again. Neither of them could establish his superiority over the other. The general battle continued, causing anxiety. O lord of the earth! While the tumultuous engagement between Drona and Pandava was going on in the course of the battle, nothing could again be seen. The sky was covered with nets of arrows, as if with nets of clouds. Creatures which travelled through the air could not find a passage.”’</p>

Having been thus addressed and given his reply, Satyaki quickly advanced, eager and indifferent.<a id="calibre_link-1715" href="#calibre_link-1835" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">74</sup></a></p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3632">‘“On seeing that he was advancing, your son received him. O king! Your son countered Shini’s descendant with arrows. A battle commenced between the lions of the Kuru and Madhava lineages. They were enraged with each other and that terrible encounter was like that between an elephant and a lion. Duryodhana drew his bow all the way back and pierced back Satvata, indomitable in battle, with ten sharp arrows. Satyaki pierced him back with ten arrows and pierced him again with fifty arrows, then with thirty, and again with ten. Satyaki swiftly showered him with arrows and severed his<a id="calibre_link-1716" href="#calibre_link-1836" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">75</sup></a> bow, with an arrow still affixed to it. O great king! Duryodhana was afflicted by Dasharha’s arrows. He was severely wounded and pained and sought refuge on another chariot. Having regained his composure, your son attacked Satyaki again. He showered a net of arrows in the direction of Yuyudhana’s chariot. O king! At this, Satyaki shot arrows towards Duryodhana’s chariot and because those arrows were shot and descended on all sides, the place became violent. A great sound arose, like that of a fire burning a great forest.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3633">‘“On seeing that Madhava, supreme among rathas, was proving to be superior, Karna desired to protect your son and quickly advanced. However, the immensely strong Bhimasena could not tolerate this. He swiftly advanced against Karna and released many arrows. Karna severed those sharp arrows and laughed. He used his arrows to sever his<a id="calibre_link-1717" href="#calibre_link-1837" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">76</sup></a> bow and arrows and killed his charioteer. Pandava Bhimasena angrily grasped a club and in that battle, used it to crush the standard, bow and charioteer of his enemy. Karna could not tolerate this and continued to fight with Bhimasena. In that battle, he used diverse nets of arrows and many kinds of weapons.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3634">‘“When that fierce encounter was going on, the king who was Dharma’s son spoke these words to the bulls among men, the tigers <a id="calibre_link-3635" class="calibre2"></a>among men from the Panchalas and the Matsyas. ‘They are our lives. They are our heads. They are immensely strong warriors. Those bulls among men are engaged with the sons of Dhritarasthra. Why are all of you stationed here, like foolish people who are bereft of their senses? Go there, where the rathas on my side are fighting. All of you should place the dharma of kshatriyas at the forefront. Get rid of your fever.<a id="calibre_link-1718" href="#calibre_link-1838" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">77</sup></a> Whether you are victorious, or whether you are slain, you will go towards the supreme objective. If you win, you will perform many sacrifices and offer large quantities of donations at these sacrifices. If you are slain, you will be united with the gods and attain sacred worlds.’ Having been thus urged by the king, those brave maharathas started to fight. They divided themselves into four formations and quickly advanced against Drona. The Panchalas advanced from one side and struck Drona with many arrows. With Bhimasena at the forefront, others surrounded him from another side. The sons of Pandu had three cunning maharathas&mdash;the twins and Bhimasena. They loudly addressed Dhananjaya. ‘O Arjuna! Quickly attack the Kurus who are following Drona. If the protectors are killed, Panchala<a id="calibre_link-1719" href="#calibre_link-1839" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">78</sup></a> will kill him.’ At this, Partha violently attacked the Kouraveyas and Drona attacked the Panchalas, with Dhrishtadyumna at the forefront.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3636">‘“Then Drona caused a great carnage among the Panchalas. He was like an enraged Shakra causing destruction among the danavas in earlier times. O great king! The enemy warriors were slaughtered by Drona’s weapons. However, because those maharathas were spirited, they were not frightened of Drona in the battle. O great king! Though they were slaughtered and confounded, the Panchalas and the Srinjayas fought against maharatha Drona. The Panchalas surrounded him from all directions and roared loudly, as they were killed by his arrows and lances. On seeing that the great-souled Panchalas were being killed in the battle and shattered because of Drona’s weapons, the Pandavas were overcome by fear. O great king! There was a great destruction of large numbers of horses and men in that battle. On seeing this, the Pandaveyas lost all hope of victory. ‘Drona knows <a id="calibre_link-3637" class="calibre2"></a>about supreme weapons. He will probably destroy all of us. He is like a raging fire amidst dry kindling, when winter is over.

But this idea did not please Dhananjaya, Kunti’s son. However, the others accepted it. And so did Yudhishthira, after some reluctance. O king! There was a gigantic elephant in his army and it was named Ashvatthama. With his club, the mighty-armed Bhima killed it. In the battle, Bhimasena then approached Drona, as if ashamed. He began to loudly exclaim, ‘Ashvatthama has been killed.’ The elephant known by the name of Ashvatthama had been killed. Knowing this in his mind, Bhima uttered a falsehood. On hearing these extremely unpleasant words from Bhima, Drona thought about this. His limbs swooned, like sand in water. But knowing about the valour of his son, he doubted that this was the truth. On hearing about the death, he did not lose his fortitude, or tremble. Having recovered his senses in a short while, Drona was comforted. He remembered that his son was incapable of being routed by enemies.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3639">‘“He attacked Parshata, wishing to kill the one who was destined to kill him. He enveloped him with thousands of sharp arrows tufted with the feathers of herons. Twenty thousand bulls among men from the Panchalas covered him with arrows from every direction, as he roamed around in that battle. Drona, the scorcher of enemies, <a id="calibre_link-3640" class="calibre2"></a>invoked a brahmastra in great anger, for the sake of killing those brave ones. Drona roamed around, killing all the Somakas. In that great battle, he brought down the heads of the Panchalas. He severed their arms, which were like clubs and were adorned with golden ornaments. In that encounter, the kings were killed by Bharadvaja’s son. They were strewn around on the ground, like trees brought down by a storm. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! Elephants and large numbers of horses were brought down. The earth became impassable because of the mire resulting from the flesh and blood. Having killed twenty thousand Panchalas, Drona roamed around on his chariot. He was stationed in that battle, flaming like a fire without smoke. Again enraged, Bharadvaja’s powerful son used a broad-headed arrow to sever Vasudana’s head from his body.<a id="calibre_link-1723" href="#calibre_link-1843" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">82</sup></a> He next killed five hundred Matsyas, six thousand Srinjayas, ten thousand elephants and ten thousand horses.

All of them spoke to Drona, the adornment of a battle. ‘You are fighting a battle characterized by adharma. The time for your death has arrived. O Drona! Look at all of us assembled here and cast aside your weapons in this battle. You should not perform cruel deeds like these yet again.

In particular, you are a brahmana. You should not perform such acts. Cast aside this veil of ignorance and base yourself on the eternal. The time that you were to spend in the world of men is now over.’ Having heard <a id="calibre_link-3641" class="calibre2"></a>their words and also the words of Bhimasena, he became distressed in that battle and looked towards Dhrishtadyumna.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3642">‘“He was tormented and pained and asked Yudhishthira, Kunti’s son, whether his son had indeed been killed or not. Drona was firm in his mind that Partha<a id="calibre_link-1726" href="#calibre_link-1846" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">85</sup></a> would not utter a falsehood, even for the sake of all the prosperity in the three worlds. It is for this reason that he asked him and no one else. Since the days of childhood, he had always hoped to hear the truth from Pandava. Knowing that Drona, the lord of a battle, was capable of emptying the earth of the Pandavas, Govinda was pained and spoke to Dharmaraja. ‘If Drona is enraged and fights for even half a day, I tell you truthfully that your army will be annihilated. Save us from Drona. In this situation, falsehood is superior to truth. If one utters a lie for the sake of saving lives, one is not touched by the taint of falsehood.’ When they were conversing, Bhimasena said, ‘O great king! As soon as I heard about the means for killing the great-souled one, I immersed myself in the Malava soldiers of Indravarma. There was an elephant named Ashvatthama and it was like Shakra’s elephant. Exhibiting my valour, I killed it in the battle and told Drona that it had been killed. “O brahmana! Ashvatthama has been killed. Stop fighting.” O bull among men! He did not believe that I had spoken the truth. Desiring victory, pay attention to Govinda’s words. O king! Tell Drona that Sharadvati’s<a id="calibre_link-1727" href="#calibre_link-1847" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">86</sup></a> son has been killed. O king! If those words come from you, the bull among brahmanas will not fight any more. O lord of men! In the world of men, you are renowned as one who speaks the truth.’ O great king! Hearing his words and urged by Krishna’s words, he decided to say what he had been asked to speak. Yudhishthira feared a lie, but was also immersed in the prospect of victory. O king! He said that he had been killed, but added the words elephant indistinctly.<a id="calibre_link-1728" href="#calibre_link-1848" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">87</sup></a> Before this, his chariot used to be borne four fingers above the ground. However, after he uttered that falsehood, <a id="calibre_link-3643" class="calibre2"></a>his chariot started to touch the earth. On hearing Yudhishthira’s words, maharatha Drona was tormented by sorrow on account of his son. He no longer wished to live. He thought that he had caused injury to the great-souled Pandavas. In his mind, he thought about the words of the rishis and about what he had heard about his son’s death. He lost his senses and was supremely anxious.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3644">‘“O king! The scorcher of enemies glanced towards Dhrishtadyumna and was no longer capable of fighting as he had done earlier. On seeing that he was extremely anxious and that he had lost his senses because of sorrow, Dhrishtadyumna, the son of the king of Panchala, attacked him. Drupada, Indra among kings, had performed a great sacrifice and had obtained him for Drona’s destruction, from the bearer of sacrificial oblations.<a id="calibre_link-1729" href="#calibre_link-1849" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">88</sup></a> He now picked up a terrible bow that rumbled like the clouds. The bowstring was firm and he affixed a divine arrow that was like a venomous serpent. Wishing to kill Drona, Panchala affixed the arrow, which was like a venomous serpent, on the bow. The form of the arrow, fixed on the circle of the bow, was like that of an immensely radiant fire. The bow looked like the sun in the sky, when summer is over. Parshata stretched that flaming bow. The soldiers saw this and thought that the time of destruction had come. On seeing it aimed towards him, Bharadvaja’s powerful son thought that the end of his bodily life had arrived. O Indra among kings! The preceptor made efforts to counter it, but the great-souled one’s weapons no longer manifested themselves.<a id="calibre_link-1730" href="#calibre_link-1850" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">89</sup></a> Though he had used them for four days and a night, they had not been exhausted.

His arrows were exhausted and he was overcome by grief on account of his son. The diverse divine weapons no longer appeared before him. Therefore, he decided to cast aside his weapons, as the sages had asked him to. But he still possessed energy and could fight like a superman. He picked up a divine bow given to him by Angirasa. With arrows that were like a brahmana’s curse, he continued to fight with Dhrishtadyumna. <a id="calibre_link-3645" class="calibre2"></a>Angry and intolerant, he enveloped Dhrishtadyumna with a great shower of arrows. Using his sharp arrows, Drona severed his arrows into a hundred fragments and brought down his standard, bow and charioteer. Dhrishtadyumna laughed and picked up another bow. Using sharp arrows, he pierced him back between the breasts. Having been severely pierced, the great archer was frightened in that encounter. However, with a broad-headed arrow that was sharp at the edges, he sliced down that great bow.<a id="calibre_link-1732" href="#calibre_link-1852" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">91</sup></a> O lord of the earth! He severed his bow and arrows and everything that the invincible one possessed, with the exception of a club and a sword. Extremely angry, the scorcher of enemies assumed a wrathful form and pierced Dhrishtadyumna with nine sharp arrows that were capable of robbing lives. Maharatha Dhrishtadyumna, immeasurable in his soul, mixed up his horses and his chariot with the horses and chariot of his adversary and then invoked a brahmastra. O bull among the Bharata lineage! The horses were as fleet as the wind and those with the complexion of pigeons were mixed with those that were red.<a id="calibre_link-1733" href="#calibre_link-1853" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">92</sup></a> It was beautiful. They were like clouds tinged with lightning, roaring at the advent of the monsoon. O great king! They were thus mingled in the field of battle and looked beautiful. The brahmana, immeasurable in his soul, sliced down the joints of Dhrishtadyumna’s arrows, wheels and chariot. His bow was severed. He was without a chariot. His horses were killed. His charioteer was slain. Facing a grave difficulty, the brave one grasped a supreme club. As it was being hurled towards him, the angry maharatha Drona, for whom truth was his valour, used his sharp arrows to strike it down.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3646">‘“On seeing that Drona, tiger among men, had destroyed it with his arrows, he grasped a sparkling sword that was as radiant as the sun and was decorated with the signs of one hundred moons.

Maharatha Dhrishtadyumna attacked with the sword that was as radiant as the sun and was decorated with the signs of one hundred <a id="calibre_link-3647" class="calibre2"></a>moons. He stood on the seat of his chariot and on the other chariot.<a id="calibre_link-1734" href="#calibre_link-1854" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">93</sup></a> He wished to perform an extremely difficult task and shattered the breast of Bharadvaja’s son in the battle. He stationed himself on the pole of the chariot and on the yoke. He killed half of those red horses and was applauded by the soldiers. Since he was stationed under those red horses, Drona could not find an opportunity to strike him and it was extraordinary. He roamed around swiftly, like a hawk desiring meat. That is how he sought to strike Drona in that encounter. Angry, the valiant Drona used iron javelins to slay, one by one, all the horses with the complexions of pigeons that were yoked to the chariot.<a id="calibre_link-1735" href="#calibre_link-1855" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">94</sup></a> Having been slain, Dhrishtadyumna’s horses fell down on the ground. O lord of the earth! The red horses were freed from that mingling of chariots. On seeing that the horses had been killed by the foremost of brahmanas, maharatha Parshata, Yajnasena’s son and foremost among warriors, could not tolerate this. He was without a chariot. The supreme among wielders of the sword grasped a sword. O king! He descended on Drona, like Vinata’s son<a id="calibre_link-1736" href="#calibre_link-1856" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">95</sup></a> swooping down on a serpent. O king! Wishing to kill Bharadvaja’s son, his appearance was beautiful.

Drona used such arrows. Other than him, only <a id="calibre_link-3649" class="calibre2"></a>Sharadvata, Partha, Drona’s son, Vaikartana, Pradyumna, Yuyudhana and Abhimanyu possessed such arrows.

O descendant of the Bharata lineage! Satyaki, for whom truth was his valour, roamed around in the paths of the chariots and was within the reach of Drona, Karna and Kripa.

This gives me great delight and also to Madri’s two sons, Bhima and King Yudhishthira. Satyaki is roaming around in this battle, with skills acquired through learning. The extender of the deeds of the Vrishni lineage seems to be toying with those maharathas. The siddhas and the soldiers are astounded.

There were shattered wheels and chariots. Giant standards were brought down. Brave riders were killed and scattered around on the ground. O supreme among the Kuru lineage! Warriors were mangled by descending arrows. In that great battle, they were seen to make many different kinds of attempts to move. The terrible battle that raged was like that between the gods and the asuras. Dharmaraja Yudhishthira spoke to the kshatriyas there. ‘O maharathas! Control yourselves and attack the one who was born in a pot. The brave Parshata has engaged with Bharadvaja’s son. To the best of his strength, he is trying to kill Bharadvaja’s son. From what we can see of his form in the great battle today, in this encounter, the angry Parshata will bring down Drona. Unite and protect him from the one who was born in a pot.’ Thus commanded by Yudhishthira, the maharatha Srinjayas wished to kill Bharadvaja’s son and attacked in unison. On seeing that all of them were descending, the maharatha who was Bharadvaja’s son powerfully attacked them, knowing that he was mortal. As he advanced, unwavering in his aim, the earth trembled. Turbulent winds began to blow, inspiring fear in the soldiers. Giant meteors seemed to issue from the sun and fell down. They were blazing in their heat and seemed to indicate great fear. O venerable one! The weapons of Bharadvaja’s son blazed. Chariots rattled loudly. Horses shed tears. The maharatha who was Bharadvaja’s son seemed to have been robbed of his energy. The rishis, knowledgeable about the brahman, had spoken to him about ascending to heaven. He decided to give up his life by fighting a fair battle. Drupada’s soldiers surrounded him from all four directions. But Drona roamed around in that battle, consuming the kshatriyas. The scorcher of enemies killed twenty thousand kshatriyas. With his sharp, pointed and fierce arrows, he killed another one hundred thousand. He was stationed in that battle, like a fire without smoke. To destroy the kshatriyas, he based himself on his brahmana qualities.</p>

Glancing towards Drona, he said, ‘With your exception, there is no other man who can venture to fight with the preceptor. Kill him quickly. The burden of his death has been placed on you.’ Thus addressed, the mighty-armed one swiftly picked up a new, firm and supreme weapon<a id="calibre_link-1744" href="#calibre_link-1864" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">103</sup></a> that was capable of bearing all loads. In that encounter, he angrily shot arrows towards the irresistible Drona. Wishing to counter the preceptor, he enveloped him with a shower of arrows. Those angry and foremost ones, ornaments of a battle, countered each other. They released brahmastras and many other divine weapons. O great king! Parshata covered Drona with great weapons in that battle and destroyed all the weapons of Bharadvaja’s son. The undecaying one began to kill the Vasatis, Shibis, Bahlikas and Kouravas, who were protecting Drona in the battle. O king! At that time, Dhrishtadyumna covered all the directions with his nets of arrows. He was as resplendent as the sun in the sky, with all its rays. Drona severed his bow and pierced him with arrows sharpened on stone. Pierced severely in his inner organs, he felt supreme pain.</p>

Dharmaraja told you about this and you should not doubt his words.’ Having been thus addressed by Bhimasena, Drona cast aside his bow. Wishing to cast aside all his weapons, the one with dharma in his soul loudly said, ‘O Karna! O Karna! O great archer! O Kripa! O Duryodhana! Make careful efforts in this battle. I am saying this repeatedly. May you be safe from the Pandavas. I am going to cast aside my weapons.’ O great king! Having said this, he loudly began to call out to Drona’s son.

Having abandoned his weapons, Drona was established in supreme tranquility. Having spoken those words, the immensely ascetic one resorted to yoga and was a mass of brightness. The preceptor ascended to heaven, which is so difficult for even virtuous ones to attain. As he ascended, it seemed to us that there were two suns in the sky. The entire sky seemed to be full of one mass of brightness and it seemed to be night when Bharadvaja’s son disappeared. In an instant, that mass of energy vanished. Confused sounds of delight were heard from the residents of heaven.

None <a id="calibre_link-3658" class="calibre2"></a>of the others could see Bharadvaja’s intelligent son. They did not know that the great one had departed, united with yoga. All the other men did not know that he had attained the supreme objective. None of them saw that he had left, in the company of the bulls among the rishis. The preceptor, the scorcher of enemies, resorted to yoga and went to Brahma’s world.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3659">‘“His limbs were mangled with hundreds of arrows and he had cast aside his weapons. All the beings were supremely pained and censured Parshata. Though they spoke to him in this way, he grasped the body, which was bereft of life, by the hair and dragged it. With the sword, he severed the head from the body. Since Bharadvaja’s son had been brought down, he was filled with great delight. In that battle, he roared like a lion and whirled his sword. His<a id="calibre_link-1749" href="#calibre_link-1869" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">108</sup></a> grey hair hung down, up to his ears. He was dark. He was eighty-five years in age. But he had roamed around on the field of battle like one who was sixteen years old. The mighty-armed Dhananjaya, Kunti’s son, said, ‘O Drupada’s son! Let the preceptor remain alive. Do not kill him. He should not be killed.’<a id="calibre_link-1750" href="#calibre_link-1870" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">109</sup></a> The soldiers had also said that he should not be killed. Arjuna, overcome with compassion, had said this repeatedly. Arjuna was overcome with compassion and so were all the kings. But disregarding them, Dhrishtadyumna killed Drona, bull among men, on the floor of his chariot. Covered with blood, that scorcher of enemies then jumped down from the chariot. His limbs were red, he was as difficult to look at as the sun, and the soldiers and others saw that he had been killed in the battle.<a id="calibre_link-1751" href="#calibre_link-1871" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">110</sup></a> O king! Before those on your side, Dhrishtadyumna, the great archer, flung down Bharadvaja’s son’s large head. O king! On seeing the head of Bharadvaja’s son, those on your side lost all enterprise. Making up their minds to run away, they fled in all the directions. Drona followed the path of the stars and ascended to heaven. O king! I witnessed the nature of Drona’s death, because of the favours of the rishi Krishna, <a id="calibre_link-3660" class="calibre2"></a>Satyavati’s son.<a id="calibre_link-1752" href="#calibre_link-1872" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">111</sup></a> He ascended like a flaming and smokeless meteor.

<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3661">‘“When Drona was killed, the Kurus, the Pandavas and the Srinjayas were distressed. They ran away at great speed and the soldiers were dispersed. In that battle, many horses were killed with sharp arrows. When Drona was killed, those on your side lost their spirits. They were defeated and suffered from great fear about what would happen next. They lost control over their selves and thought that they had lost both.<a id="calibre_link-1753" href="#calibre_link-1873" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">112</sup></a> The kings searched for the severed body of Bharadvaja’s son. O king! But because the field was covered with headless torsos, they could not find it. Having obtained victory, the Pandavas thought about the great fame that would follow. They made loud sounds with their arrows and roared like lions. O king! In the midst of the soldiers, Bhimasena and Parshata Dhrishtadyumna were seen to embrace each other. Bhima spoke to Parshata, the scorcher of enemies. ‘O Parshata! I will embrace you again, as the victorious one, when the wicked son of a suta and Dhritarashtra’s evil son have been killed in the battle.’ Having said this, Bhima was filled with great joy. Pandava made the earth tremble with the slapping of his arms. Terrified by that sound, those on your side fled from the battle. They abandoned the dharma of kshatriyas and devoted themselves to running away. O lord of the earth! Having obtained victory, the Pandavas were delighted. Because their enemies were destroyed in the battle, they were overjoyed. O king! When Drona was killed, the Kurus were afflicted with arrows. With their leader slain, they were shattered. They were overcome with supreme sorrow. They lost their senses and lost their enterprise. With their energy destroyed, they were full of lassitude.</p>
<a id="calibre_link-3662" class="calibre2"></a>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3663">‘“They lamented loudly and surrounded your son. They were covered with dust. They trembled and glanced in the ten directions.

Your son was unable to remain amidst them and moved away. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! Your warriors were overcome by hunger and thirst and were exhausted. They were severely scorched by the sun and were cheerless in their hearts. They were enraged on seeing the fall of Bharadvaja’s son, which was like the sun falling down or the ocean drying up, or Meru moving or Vasava being defeated. O king! The Kouravas were frightened and began to run away. On seeing that the one on the golden chariot had been killed, Shakuni, the king of Gandhara, fled with the other frightened rathas, but faster than the others. The son of a suta also fled with his large army and the army ran away with great force, with its standards. Shalya, the lord of Madra, glanced here and there and fled out of fear, with an army that had chariots, elephants and horses stationed in front. While many of the foremost ones had been slain, Sharadvata fled with the many elephants and foot soldiers that remained, saying that this was a great calamity. O king! Kritavarma fled on swift horses, surrounded by the remnants from the divisions of the Bhojas, the Kalingas, the Arattas and the Bahlikas. O king! On seeing that Drona had been brought down, Uluka was terrified and fled with large numbers of frightened infantry. Duhshasana was handsome and young. He possessed valour and all the good signs. However, he was also extremely anxious and fled, surrounded by elephants. O great king! Maharatha Duryodhana fled, surrounded by elephants, horses, chariots and infantry. The remnants of the army were routed and ran away, astride elephants, chariots and dark horses. The men lost their enterprise and their energy and thought that the army had been destroyed. O lord! Abandoning their armour, those on your side ran away. O bull among the Bharata lineage! The soldiers loudly called out to each other, ‘Stay. Remain.’ <a id="calibre_link-3664" class="calibre2"></a>But they themselves did not remain there. They abandoned their chariots and their ornamented charioteers. Other warriors climbed onto their horses, or swiftly fled on foot. The soldiers were frightened and lost all their energy. They were terrified.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3665">‘“Drona’s son was the only one who advanced against the enemy, like a crocodile against a current. Indomitable in battle, he killed many kinds of Pandu soldiers. He was like a crazy elephant in his valour and freed himself from many difficult situations. When he saw that the soldiers were running away, having made up their minds to flee, Drona’s son approached Duryodhana and spoke to him. ‘O descendant of the Bharata lineage! Why are the soldiers running away and why are they frightened? O Indra among kings! They are running away in the battle. Why are you not restraining them? O lord of men! You do not seem to be your natural self either. Karna and the other kings are also not stationed here. In no other encounter have the soldiers run away in this fashion. O mighty-armed one! O descendant of the Bharata lineage! Why have your soldiers been reduced to this state? O king! Has a lion among rathas in your army been killed? O Kourava! Tell me everything about why this state has come to pass.’ Having heard what Drona’s son said, Duryodhana, the bull among kings, was incapable of telling him the terrible and unpleasant news. Your son was immersed in an ocean of grief, like a shattered boat. On seeing Drona’s son stationed on his chariot, his voice choked with tears. The king shame-facedly told Sharadvata, ‘O fortunate one! Before all the others, you explain why all the soldiers are running away.’ The king went to Sharadvata and repeatedly entreated him that he should tell Drona’s son about how Drona had been brought down.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3666">‘“Kripa said, ‘We placed Drona, supreme among rathas on earth, ahead of us and began to fight with only the Panchalas. A battle with a melee of the Kurus and the Somakas then commenced. They roared at each other and brought down weapons on each other’s bodies. Drona, bull among men, released the brahmastra and killed hundreds and thousands of enemies with his broad-headed arrows. In particular, goaded by destiny, Pandavas, Kekayas, Matsyas and Panchalas approached Drona’s chariot in that battle and were destroyed. With <a id="calibre_link-3667" class="calibre2"></a>his brahmastra, Drona consumed and sent one thousand lions among rathas and two thousand elephants to the land of the dead. His grey hair hung down up to his ears. He was dark. He was eighty-five years old. However, in that encounter, the aged Drona roamed around like one who was sixteen years old. He destroyed the soldiers and killed the kings. Though the Panchalas were angered, they were made to retreat. Part of the forces was shattered and retreated. The conqueror of enemies<a id="calibre_link-1755" href="#calibre_link-1875" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">114</sup></a> invoked a divine weapon that was as resplendent as a sun that has arisen. The powerful one reached amidst the Pandus, with his arrows as rays. Your father was like the midday sun and was difficult to look at. They were scorched by Drona, as if by the blazing sun. Their valour was scorched. They lost their enterprise. They were bereft of their senses. On seeing that they were afflicted by Drona’s arrows, Madhusudana, who wished for the victory of the sons of Pandu, spoke these words. “He is supreme among the wielders of weapons. He is like the leader of a herd of leaders. He is incapable of being vanquished by the enemy in battle, even if it were to be the slayer of Vritra himself. O Pandavas! Therefore, abandon dharma and seek to ensure victory. Otherwise, the one on the golden chariot will kill all of you in the battle. It is my view that he will not fight if Ashvatthama has been killed. Therefore, let someone utter a falsehood and tell him that he<a id="calibre_link-1756" href="#calibre_link-1876" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">115</sup></a> has been killed in the battle.” Dhananjaya, Kunti’s son, did not approve of these words. But all the others approved, Yudhishthira with great difficulty. Bhimasena shame-facedly told your father that Ashvatthama had been killed, but your father did not believe him. Suspecting that this was a lie, your father, who was devoted to his son, asked Dharmaraja whether you had actually been killed or not. Yudhishthira was scared of speaking a lie, but was addicted to the prospect of victory. He said that Ashvatthama had been killed and indistinctly added that it was an elephant. This belonged to Indravarma from Malava and was as large as a mountain. It was killed by Bhima. He<a id="calibre_link-1757" href="#calibre_link-1877" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">116</sup></a> approached Drona and spoke these <a id="calibre_link-3668" class="calibre2"></a>words. “You are wielding weapons for Ashvatthama’s sake. You live for the sake of beholding him. He has always been your beloved son. But he has been brought down.” On hearing this extremely unpleasant news, the preceptor was distressed. He gave up his divine weapons and no longer fought, as he had earlier. He was extremely anxious and his senses were numb with grief. On seeing this, the son of the king of Panchala, the performer of cruel deeds, attacked. The one who knew about the nature of the worlds<a id="calibre_link-1758" href="#calibre_link-1878" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">117</sup></a> saw the one who was destined to be the cause of his death. In the battle, he abandoned his divine weapons and decided to die.<a id="calibre_link-1759" href="#calibre_link-1879" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">118</sup></a> Parshata grasped his hair with his left hand. Ignoring the loud words spoken by the brave ones, he severed his head. Everyone said, “Do not kill the one who should not be killed.” Arjuna jumped down from his chariot and quickly ran, with his arms raised. He repeatedly exclaimed, “O one who knows about dharma! Let the preceptor remain alive. Do not kill him.” O bull among men! But though he was restrained by the Kouravas and by Arjuna, he cruelly killed your father. That is the reason all the soldiers are running away, afflicted by fear. O unblemished one! With your father slain, we have also lost all initiative.’”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3669">‘Sanjaya said, “On hearing of his father’s death in the battle, Drona’s son was overcome by fierce rage, like a snake that has been stepped on, by the foot.”’</p>

On hearing that his aged brahmana father had been killed by Dhrishtadyumna <a id="calibre_link-3679" class="calibre2"></a>through adharma, what did Ashvatthama say? Human, varuna, agneya, brahma, aindra and narayana weapons were always vested in the valiant one.<a id="calibre_link-5" href="#calibre_link-1881" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">1</sup></a> O Sanjaya! He was always devoted to dharma. On hearing that the preceptor had been killed by Dhrishtadyumna through the use of adharma, what did Ashvatthama say? The great-souled one obtained his knowledge of Dhanurveda from Rama.<a id="calibre_link-6" href="#calibre_link-1882" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">2</sup></a> Wishing to be like a preceptor towards his son, he gave him all these divine weapons. There is only one person in the world whom men desire to possess qualities that are superior to those in their own selves. That is the son. There is no one else. All great-souled preceptors pass on the secrets to their sons and to their devoted students. O Sanjaya! He especially obtained all those skills. In a battle, Sharadvati’s brave son has become like a second Drona. He is like Rama in knowledge of the sacred texts and like Purandara in battle. He is Kartavirya’s equal in valour and Brihaspati’s equal in intelligence.<a id="calibre_link-7" href="#calibre_link-1883" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">3</sup></a> The young one is like a mountain in his fortitude and like the fire in his energy. He is like the ocean in gravity and like a serpent’s venom in his anger. He is firm in wielding the bow and has conquered exhaustion. He is the foremost among rathas in the world. He is as swift as the wind in speed. He roams around like an enraged Yama. When he is stationed in battle, the earth itself seems to suffer. Truth is his valour and the brave one is not distressed in battle. He has learnt the Vedas. He knows about sacrifices. He is skilled in Dhanurveda. Like the great ocean and like Rama, Dasharatha’s son, he is not agitated. In the battle, a person who followed dharma was killed by Dhrishtadyumna through the use of adharma. On hearing about the preceptor’s death, what did Ashvatthama say? The great-souled one was created for Dhrishtadyumna’s death, just as Panchala, Yajnasena’s son, was generated for Drona’s destruction. He<a id="calibre_link-8" href="#calibre_link-1884" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">4</sup></a> was <a id="calibre_link-3680" class="calibre2"></a>killed violently by a cruel and wicked one who did not possess foresight. On hearing about the preceptor’s death, what did Ashvatthama say?”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3681">‘Sanjaya replied, “O bull among men! On hearing that his father had been killed through deception by the wicked one, Drona’s son’s eyes filled with tears and he was angry. O Indra among kings! Because of the rage, his body seemed divine. It was like that of the Destroyer, wishing to consume beings at the end of a yuga. He repeatedly wiped his eyes, which were full of tears. He sighed in anger and spoke these words to Duryodhana. ‘My father was brought down by inferior ones after he had cast aside his weapons. A wicked act has been committed by those who should have upheld the standard of dharma. Dharma’s son acted ignobly and cruelly. I have heard everything about all that now. If one is engaged in a battle, there will either be victory, or there will be defeat. O king! Of the two, death is always praised. If death results in a battle where the fight is according to norms of fairness, there should not be sorrow. This is what brahmanas have said. There is no doubt that my father has gone to the world reserved for heroes. I should not sorrow for that tiger among men because he has been slain. However, though he was engaged in dharma, his hair was seized while all the soldiers looked one. That is tearing out my vitals. Because of desire, anger, ignorance, insolence and folly, acts of adharma are performed to subdue others. In that way, Parshata has performed this great act of adharma. The evil-souled one has acted cruelly and has certainly disregarded me. Dhrishtadyumna will witness the extremely terrible consequences of that. He has performed an extremely ignoble deed and so has the liar Pandava. They resorted to deception against the preceptor, when he had cast aside his weapons. That is the reason the earth will drink Dharmaraja’s blood today. I will use every means to kill Panchala. I will kill Dhrishtadyumna, the perpetrator of a wicked deed, in the battle, whether the task be a gentle or a violent one. O Kourava! Having killed Panchala, I will obtain peace. O tiger among men! This is the reason men desire sons, so that they may be saved from great calamities in this world and the next. My father was reduced to a miserable state, as if he had no relatives, <a id="calibre_link-3682" class="calibre2"></a>and this was while I, his son and his student, was still alive, like a mountain. Shame on my divine weapons. Shame on my arms. Shame on my valour. Though he possessed a son, Drona’s hair was seized. O supreme among the Bharata lineage! I will act so that I am freed of the debt I owe to my father, who has now gone to the world hereafter. Noble ones never praise themselves. However, because I am angry at my father’s death, I am now speaking about my manliness. The Pandavas, with Janardana, will witness my valour today. I will crush all the soldiers, as if it is the end of a yuga. O bull among men! While I am stationed on my chariot, gods, gandharvas, asuras and rakshasas will be incapable of defeating me in the battle today. In the world, there is no one superior to me and Arjuna in use of weapons. I will blaze amidst the soldiers, like the rays of the sun, and use weapons created by the gods. In the battle today, I will use them against the son of the one with the lean horses.<a id="calibre_link-9" href="#calibre_link-1885" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">5</sup></a> I will exhibit my valour and crush the Pandavas. O king! Today, all the directions will be enveloped with showers of my sharp arrows and those on our side will see this. I will shroud everything with nets of arrows that make a fearful noise. I will bring down the enemy, like trees uprooted by a violent storm. O Kouravya! Bibhatsu, Janardana, Bhimasena, the twins, King Yudhishthira, the evil-souled Parshata, Shikhandi and Satyaki do not know the weapons that I possess, or techniques for releasing and withdrawing them. In earlier times, Narayana appeared before my father in the form of a brahmana, who worshipped him in accordance with the proper rites and tendered him offerings. Having received them himself, the illustrious one offered to grant him a boon. My father asked for the supreme narayana weapon. O king! The illustrious one, supreme among the gods, told him,<a id="calibre_link-10" href="#calibre_link-1886" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">6</sup></a> “There will never be another man who will be as great a warrior as you. O brahmana! However, you must never use this suddenly. This weapon never returns without killing the enemy at whom it has been aimed. O lord! But it is impossible to know <a id="calibre_link-3683" class="calibre2"></a>whom it will not kill. It might even slay those who should not be killed. Therefore, it should not be used.<a id="calibre_link-11" href="#calibre_link-1887" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">7</sup></a> O scorcher of enemies! In a battle, this great weapon must not be used to kill those who are running away, those who have cast aside their weapons, enemies who have yielded and those who have sought refuge. In a battle, if it is used to kill those who should not be slain, it will always oppress the user himself.” My father received it. The lord also told me, “In a battle, with this weapon, your energy will blaze and you will be able to shower down many divine weapons.” Having said this, the illustrious lord went to heaven. That is how my relative<a id="calibre_link-12" href="#calibre_link-1888" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">8</sup></a> obtained the narayana weapon. With it, I will drive away the Pandavas, Panchalas, Matysas and Kekayas in the encounter, like Sachi’s consort<a id="calibre_link-13" href="#calibre_link-1889" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">9</sup></a> against the asuras. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! With this, my arrows will be showered wherever I wish and destroy the valour of the enemy. I will be stationed in the battle and bring down innumerable showers of stones and use arrows with iron heads to drive away the maharathas. There is no doubt that I will bring down many different kinds of battleaxes. O scorcher of enemies! With the great <em class="calibre4">narayanastra</em>, I will destroy the enemy and repulse the Pandavas. The wicked Panchala hates his friends, brahmanas and his preceptor. He has performed an extremely despised deed and will not escape from me with his life.’ Having heard Drona’s son, the army returned.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3684">‘“Those supreme among men blew on giant conch shells. Cheerfully, they sounded drums and thousands of smaller drums. The earth roared with the sound of hooves and wheels. That tremendous sound echoed on earth, the sky and heaven. The Pandavas heard that sound, which was like the thunder of clouds. Those best of rathas united and consulted each other. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! Having spoken those words, Drona’s son touched water and invoked the divine narayana weapon.”’</p>

The earth trembled and the great oceans were agitated. Instead of flowing towards the ocean, the rivers flowed in an opposite direction. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! The summits of mountains were shattered. Small animals kept the sons of Pandu to the right.<a id="calibre_link-14" href="#calibre_link-1890" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">10</sup></a> There was darkness and the sun became dim. Different kinds of carnivorous beings cheerfully descended there. O lord of the earth! The gods, danavas and gandharvas were terrified. On seeing ferocity, all the kings became extremely anxious.

On seeing that the Kurus were attacking, what consultations did the Pandavas hold, so that Dhrishtadyumna might be protected? Tell me everything.”</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3689">‘Sanjaya replied, “Earlier, Yudhishthira had seen that the sons of Dhritarashtra were running away. Now he heard them make a tremendous noise and spoke to Arjuna. ‘The preceptor, Drona, has been killed by Dhrishtadyumna in the battle, like the great asura, Vritra, slain by the one with the vajra in his hand. O Dhananjaya! The Kurus lost all hope of being victorious in the battle. They were miserable in their minds. They fled, making up their minds to protect themselves. With their parshnis and charioteers slain, some swiftly fled on their chariots. The kings were without flags, standards and umbrellas and the poles of their chariots were shattered. The seats of the chariots were broken. Some lost their senses and climbed onto horses. Some were frightened and themselves urged the horses of their chariots with their feet. With the yokes, wheels and axles <a id="calibre_link-3690" class="calibre2"></a>broken, some were distressed and quickly fled. Others were dislodged from the backs of elephants and pinned there by iron arrows. Elephants were killed by the storms of arrows and driven away in the ten directions. Others lost their weapons and armour and their mounts took to the ground. Others were crushed by broken wheels and horses and elephants. As they fled from the enemy in fear, they loudly called out to fathers and sons. They lost their energy and were overcome by depression. They could no longer recognize each other. Some removed the armour from the severely wounded bodies of sons, fathers, friends and brothers and washed them with water. After Drona was killed, the army was quickly reduced to such a state. How has it returned again? If you know this, tell me. There are the sounds of horses neighing and elephants trumpeting. This is mingling with the loud sound from the roaring of chariot wheels. This great and fierce sound has arisen in the ocean of the Kurus. It is repeatedly arising and is making those on my side tremble. It is my view that this will swallow up the three worlds, together with Indra. I think that this fierce and loud roar is being made by the wielder of the vajra himself. On Drona being killed, Vasava is appearing on the side of the Kouravas. Our body hair is standing erect and the rathas and elephants are anxious. O Dhananjaya! What is this extremely fierce uproar that can be heard there? The Kouravas were in a shattered state. Which maharatha, like the lord of the gods, has rallied them for the sake of fighting in this battle?’</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3691">‘“Arjuna said, ‘They are ready to perform fierce deeds, basing themselves on patience. The Kouravas are making a noise and blowing on conch shells, depending on the valour of a person. After the preceptor cast aside his weapons and was slain, there should be no doubts about who that person is. The sons of Dhritarashtra have resorted to him and are roaring. The mighty-armed one is modest. He is like a crazy elephant in his gait. His face is glossy and he is the performer of fierce deeds. He has freed the Kurus from their fear. When he was born, Drona gave the wealth of one thousand cows to brahmanas. That Ashvatthama is roaring. As soon as he was born, the brave one neighed like Uchchaihshrava and the earth and the <a id="calibre_link-3692" class="calibre2"></a>three worlds trembled because of this. On hearing this, an invisible voice named him Ashvatthama then.<a id="calibre_link-16" href="#calibre_link-1892" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">12</sup></a> O Pandava! That brave one is roaring now. There was the one<a id="calibre_link-17" href="#calibre_link-1893" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">13</sup></a> who was killed by Parshata, as if he was without a protector. It was an extremely cruel deed and his protector is now stationed there. Panchala grievously seized my preceptor’s hair. Because of that, and because of his own manliness, Drona’s son will not forgive him. Because of the kingdom, you have also spoken a falsehood to the preceptor. Though you know about dharma and are known as a virtuous person, you have performed an extremely grave deed of adharma. “Pandava knows about all forms of dharma. He is also my student. He will not utter a lie.” Thinking this, he<a id="calibre_link-18" href="#calibre_link-1894" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">14</sup></a> believed what you said. You spoke a lie, though you garbed it in the guise of truth when you spoke to the preceptor, since you said that an elephant had been killed. At this, he discarded his weapons and became indifferent. O king! He was bereft of his senses and became distracted. O lord! You saw what happened. Affectionate towards his son, he was unwilling to fight and was full of sorrow. Abandoning eternal dharma, the preceptor was killed by the student.<a id="calibre_link-19" href="#calibre_link-1895" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">15</sup></a> Though he had cast aside his weapons, your preceptor was killed and this was adharma. If you can, protect Parshata with all your advisers. With his relative slain, he will now be devoured by the preceptor’s angry son. Even if all of us try, we will not be able to protect Parshata today. He<a id="calibre_link-20" href="#calibre_link-1896" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">16</sup></a> is extremely affectionate towards all beings. On hearing that his father was seized by the hair, he will destroy us in the battle today. I loudly exclaimed that the preceptor should be protected. However, transgressing his own dharma, the student slew the preceptor. We have already spent most of our lives and only a little bit is left. But now, even that little bit has been tainted by this great act of adharma. <a id="calibre_link-3693" class="calibre2"></a>He<a id="calibre_link-21" href="#calibre_link-1897" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">17</sup></a> was always like a father in his affection.

O lord of the earth! Dhritarashtra gave the entire earth to Bhishma and Drona and his sons, who were even more valuable. Having obtained such a livelihood from him, he always treated the others<a id="calibre_link-23" href="#calibre_link-1899" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">19</sup></a> well. The preceptor always loved us, even more than his son. He was not subjugated by us in the battle. He was killed by your words, when he cast aside his weapons. Had he fought, even Shatakratu<a id="calibre_link-24" href="#calibre_link-1900" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">20</sup></a> would not have been able to kill him. The preceptor was aged. He always did what was good for us. But we injured him. We have performed an ignoble deed for the sake of the kingdom and because of our limited intelligence. My preceptor had always known that I, Vasava’s son, would have given up everything out of affection for him&mdash;sons, brothers, fathers, wives, and even life itself. But because of desire for the kingdom, I ignored him when he was being killed. O king! O lord! Because of that, I am covered with shame and have attained hell. He was a brahmana. He was an aged preceptor. He had cast aside his weapons. He was like a sage. We have killed him today, for the sake of the kingdom. It is better for us to be dead than to remain alive.’”’</p>

However, mighty-armed Bhimasena was angry and spoke these words, censuring Kounteya Arjuna. ‘O Partha! You speak words full of dharma, like a hermit who has retired to the forest, or like a brahmana rigid in his vows raising his staff. Saving others from injury, protecting one’s own life from injury and exhibiting forgiveness towards women and the virtuous&mdash;with these qualities, a kshatriya swiftly obtains the earth and attains dharma, fame and prosperity. O extender of the lineage! You are vested with all the qualities of kshatriyas. It is not proper that you should now speak like one who is ignorant. O Kounteya! Your valour is like that of Shakra, Shachi’s consort. Like the ocean does not cross the shoreline, you do not transgress dharma. Which person amongst us will not applaud you? Serving dharma, you pushed back your rage for thirteen years. O son!<a id="calibre_link-25" href="#calibre_link-1901" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">21</sup></a> It is through good fortune that your mind has turned towards your own dharma today. O one without decay! It is through good fortune that your mind has turned towards non-violence today. With the kingdom deprived through adharma, you have turned towards dharma. Droupadi was supremely afflicted when she was brought into the assembly hall by the enemy. We were exiled to the forest, with bark and deerskin as garments. We did not deserve this, but we were made to endure it for thirteen years by the enemy. O unblemished one! These are reasons for anger, but you have abandoned your rage. Yet, you say that you are devoted to the dharma of kshatriyas in every way. “Remembering all those acts of adharma, I have united with you today. I will kill the inferior ones who have robbed us of the kingdom, together with their followers.” This is what you said earlier, when we assembled to do battle. “I will strive to the utmost of my capacity.” But you are censuring us now. You have said that you wish to abide by your own dharma, but you are falsifying those words now. We are afflicted by fear and your words are striking us in our inner organs. O destroyer of enemies! You are pouring a corrosive onto the sores of those who are wounded. My heart has been shattered, afflicted by the stakes of your words. You are great in your adharma. You <a id="calibre_link-3697" class="calibre2"></a>do not know what it means to follow dharma. You have not praised us, though we have been praiseworthy. You have praised one who is not even one-sixteenth part of you.<a id="calibre_link-26" href="#calibre_link-1902" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">22</sup></a> You have spoken about your own self, but not about those who are vested with all the qualities.

I can hurl the terrible and heavy club that is garlanded with gold, and with it I can shatter trees that are as large as mountains and uproot them like the wind. O bull among men! You should know that your brother is such a person. O one with infinite valour! You should not be frightened of Drona’s son. O Bibhatsu! Otherwise, stay here, with all the bulls among men.

The learned ones have laid down certain tasks for brahmanas&mdash;officiating at sacrifices, teaching, donations, performance of sacrifices, receiving gifts and sixth, studying. O Partha! You have reproached me. To which of these was Drona, who has been slain by me, devoted? He transgressed his own dharma and devoted himself to the dharma of kshatriyas. The performer of inferior deeds killed us through the use of superhuman weapons. He said that he was a brahmana, but resorted to the use of maya. O Partha! He has himself been slain through the use of maya today. So what? If Drona has been punished by me and his son roars loudly and fiercely in anger, how do I suffer because of that? I do not think it is extraordinary that Drona’s son should only roar in this way. He is incapable of protecting the Kouravas and will cause their death. You say that you are devoted to dharma and have described me as my preceptor’s killer. But it was for that reason that I was born from the fire, as the son of Panchala. O Dhananjaya! How can you describe <a id="calibre_link-3699" class="calibre2"></a>him as a brahmana or a kshatriya? When he fought in the battle, he thought good and evil acts were the same. Overcome by anger, he used the brahmastra to even kill those who were unacquainted with the use of weapons. O supreme among men! Why should we not use any means to kill him? Those who know about dharma say that those who are for adharma are like poison. O Arjuna! You know about dharma and artha. Why are you censuring me? He was violent and I brought him down from his chariot. O Bibhatsu! Why are you reproaching me? You should congratulate me. O Partha! In the battle, I have severed the terrible Drona’s head. He was like the blazing sun and like poison. I should be praised, but you are not praising me. In the battle, he slew my relatives and not those of anyone else. Having only severed his head, my fever<a id="calibre_link-28" href="#calibre_link-1904" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">24</sup></a> has not been assuaged. My heart is still suffering, because I did not hurl his head, like Jayadratha’s head, into the land of the nishadas.<a id="calibre_link-29" href="#calibre_link-1905" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">25</sup></a> O Arjuna! It has been instructed that not killing one’s enemy is tantamount to adharma. Yet again, the dharma of kshatriyas is to kill, or be killed. O Pandava! In accordance with dharma, I have killed my enemy in the battle. This is just as you killed the brave Bhagadatta, your father’s friend.<a id="calibre_link-30" href="#calibre_link-1906" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">26</sup></a> Having struck your grandfather<a id="calibre_link-31" href="#calibre_link-1907" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">27</sup></a> in the battle, you thought that you were acting in accordance with dharma.

But Satyaki spoke. ‘Is there no man here who will quickly kill this wicked man, the worst of men? He is speaking unpleasant words. How are his tongue and head not shattering into a hundred fragments? When the inferior one committed the act of adharma by injuring his preceptor, why was he not brought down?

Having performed a deed that should not have been performed, you are again showing hatred towards your preceptor. Because of that, you should be killed by us. You should not remain alive for a single instant. Who other than this wretch among men would kill a virtuous preceptor, who had dharma in his soul, and then seize him by the hair? O defiler of the lineage! You have degraded seven generations of your ancestors and seven generations of your descendants and deprived them of all their fame. You have spoken to Partha, bull among men, about Bhishma, but that great-souled one himself decided the means of his death.

You wish to censure others. But Bhurishrava’s arm had been severed and he was fasting to death. You were restrained from striking him. What can be more evil than that? In the battle, Drona used his divine weapons and cornered me in a vyuha. I killed him when he had cast aside his weapons. O cruel one! What was wicked about that deed?

There is nothing superior to forgiveness.’ O venerable one! Shini’s descendant was pacified by Sahadeva. The son of the king of Panchala laughed and spoke these words. ‘O Bhima! Release Shini’s grandson. Free him. He prides himself in fighting. Let him advance against me, like the wind against mountains. I will destroy his pride with my sharp arrows. O Kounteya! In the encounter, I will rob him of his love for fighting and of his life. The Kouravas are advancing.

I tell you truthfully that I will rout them and kill the wicked Panchala. I will kill all of them, if they fight against me in the battle. Know this to be the truth. Therefore, make your soldiers return.’ On hearing these words, your son made his soldiers return, dispelling their great fear with a loud roar, like that of a lion. O king! The Kuru and Pandava soldiers clashed again. There was a fierce encounter, like that between two swelling oceans. Drona’s son incited and rallied the Kouravas. At Drona’s death, the Pandus and the Panchalas also became fierce. Both sides were extremely cheerful and saw themselves as victorious. They were enraged, and with great force, advanced <a id="calibre_link-3712" class="calibre2"></a>on that field of battle. O Indra among kings! It was like a mountain clashing against a mountain, or an ocean against another ocean. That was the way the Kurus and the Pandavas rushed against each other. The Kuru and Pandava soldiers were delighted and blew on thousands of conch shells and sounded tens of thousands of drums.

After this, iron balls appeared, like blazing stellar bodies in the clear sky. The four directions were covered by wonderful shataghnis that were like the fire. They possessed wheels and were sharp as razors. They formed circles and blazed. O bull among the Bharata lineage! The sky was densely covered with these weapons. On seeing this, the Pandus, the Panchalas and the Srinjayas became anxious. O lord of men! Wherever the maharatha Pandavas fought, in those spots, that weapon increased in power. They were slain by that narayana weapon. All of them were consumed, as if by a fire, and became frightened in that battle. O lord! At the end of the winter, a conflagration burns down dry wood. Like that, that weapon consumed the Pandu soldiers. On every side, the soldiers were destroyed by that weapon. On seeing this, the lord Yudhishthira, Dharma’s son, was overcome by supreme terror.

<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3716">‘“He spoke these words. ‘Swiftly lay down your weapons and descend from your mounts and your horses. This is the method of countering, decreed by the great-souled one.<a id="calibre_link-54" href="#calibre_link-1930" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">50</sup></a> All of you descend from the elephants, the horses and the chariots onto the ground. If <a id="calibre_link-3717" class="calibre2"></a>you are on the ground and without weapons, this weapon will not kill you. Wherever warriors fight against the strength of this weapon, in those spots, the Kouravas will become stronger. But those men who fling away their weapons and descend from their mounts, will not be slain by this weapon in the battle. But all those who seek to counter it, even in their minds, will be killed, even if they descend to the nether regions.’ O descendant of the Bharata lineage! On hearing Vasudeva’s words, all of them flung away their weapons and cast aside any thought of fighting, even in their minds.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3718">‘“O king! On seeing that they wished to cast aside their weapons, Pandava Bhimasena cheerfully spoke these words. ‘No one should, under any circumstances, cast aside weapons. I will use my arrows to quickly counter the weapon of Drona’s son. My heavy club is decorated with gold. In this battle, I will roam around like Death and use it to destroy the weapon of Drona’s son. There is no man who is my equal in valour, just as there is no stellar body that is equal to the sun. Behold my firm arms. They are like the trunk of a king of elephants. These are capable of bringing down a mountain, with its summit. I am the only man who has the might of ten thousand elephants. I am without a peer, just as the renowned Shakra is amidst the gods in heaven. Let them behold the strength of my arms and my broad chest in the battle, as I repulse the flaming and blazing weapon of Drona’s son. While the Kurus and the Pandus look on, if there is no one else who is capable of countering the narayana weapon, I will repulse it today.’ Having thus spoken, Bhima, the scorcher of enemies, advanced against Drona’s son on a chariot that was as radiant as the sun and roared like the clouds. Kunti’s son was dexterous, swift and valiant and in a short instant, enveloped him<a id="calibre_link-55" href="#calibre_link-1931" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">51</sup></a> with a net of arrows. Drona’s son laughed at this and addressed him.<a id="calibre_link-56" href="#calibre_link-1932" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">52</sup></a> He invoked mantras and shrouded him with arrows that flamed at the tips. In that battle, Partha was enveloped with these. They were like blazing serpents, with flames emerging from their mouths. They were like golden sparks. O king! In that encounter, Bhimasena’s form was like that <a id="calibre_link-3719" class="calibre2"></a>of a mountain when the day is done, covered with fireflies. O great king! That weapon of Drona’s son was aimed and increased in its influence, like a fire fanned by the wind. On seeing that the weapon, terrible in its power, was increasing in its influence, all the Pandu soldiers were overcome by great fear, with the exception of Bhima. All of them laid down their weapons on the ground. All of them alighted from their chariots, elephants and horses. When they had thrown down their weapons and descended from their mounts, the great power of that weapon descended on Bhima’s head. All beings, especially the Pandavas, uttered sounds of lamentation, when they saw that Bhimasena was covered by the energy of that weapon.”’</p>

<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-3721">‘Sanjaya said, “On seeing that Bhimasena was shrouded by that weapon, Dhananjaya released the varuna weapon to counter its energy. However, because of Arjuna’s dexterity and because he was covered by energy, no one noticed that he had been covered by the varuna weapon.<a id="calibre_link-57" href="#calibre_link-1933" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">53</sup></a> Bhima, with his horses, charioteer and chariot, was covered by the weapon of Drona’s son. He was like a blazing fire in the midst of another fire and it was extremely difficult to look at him. O king! Just as all stellar bodies head towards Mount Asta<a id="calibre_link-58" href="#calibre_link-1934" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">54</sup></a> when night is over, all those arrows descended towards Bhimasena’s chariot. O venerable one! Bhima, his chariot, his horses and his charioteer seemed to be in the midst of a fire created by Drona’s son. It was as if the entire universe, with its mobile and immobile objects, was consumed by a fire at the appointed time,<a id="calibre_link-59" href="#calibre_link-1935" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">55</sup></a> which then entered the mouth of the Creator. Thus did that weapon enter Bhima. <a id="calibre_link-3722" class="calibre2"></a>It was like the sun entering the fire, or like the fire entering the sun. Such was the energy with which it penetrated that no one could see anything. The power of that weapon extended in the direction of Bhima’s chariot. And in that battle, the power of Drona’s son increased and there was no one to counter him. All the soldiers of the Pandus had laid down their weapons and were bereft of their senses. All the maharathas, with Yudhishthira at the forefront, had turned their faces away.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3723">‘“On seeing all this, the brave and immensely radiant Arjuna and Vasudeva quickly descended from their chariot and dashed towards Bhima. There was an energy created from the strength of the weapon of Drona’s son. Those two immensely strong ones resorted to their power of maya and immersed themselves in it. Because they had cast aside their weapons, because of the use of the varuna weapon and because of their own energy, those two Krishnas were not burnt by the fire of that weapon. To pacify the narayana weapon, Nara and Narayana<a id="calibre_link-60" href="#calibre_link-1936" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">56</sup></a> forcefully dragged Bhima away, together with all his weapons. While he was being dragged away, maharatha Kounteya<a id="calibre_link-61" href="#calibre_link-1937" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">57</sup></a> continued to roar loudly and this fanned the extremely invincible and fierce weapon of Drona’s son. Vasudeva said, ‘O son of Pandu! O Kounteya! Though you have been restrained, why are you not retreating from this battle? If the descendants of the Kourava lineage could have been defeated through fighting, then we, and all these bulls among men, would have fought. All those on your side have descended from their chariots. O Kounteya! Therefore, descend from your chariot too.’ Having thus addressed him, Krishna brought him<a id="calibre_link-62" href="#calibre_link-1938" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">58</sup></a> down from his chariot, though he sighed like a serpent and his eyes were red with rage. When he was brought down from the chariot onto the ground and forced to cast aside his weapons, the narayana weapon, the scorcher of enemies, was pacified. The energy, which was difficult to withstand, became pacified. All the directions and the sub-directions became clear. Auspicious winds began to blow and <a id="calibre_link-3724" class="calibre2"></a>the animals and birds were calmed. O lord of men! The mounts and the warriors became cheerful. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! When its<a id="calibre_link-63" href="#calibre_link-1939" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">59</sup></a> fierce energy was dispelled, the intelligent Bhima looked resplendent, like the sun that arises at the end of the night. On seeing that the supreme weapon was pacified, the remnants of the Pandava army stationed themselves, wishing to kill your sons.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3725">‘“O great king! When the weapon was countered and the soldiers were stationed thus, Duryodhana spoke to Drona’s son. ‘O Ashvatthama! Quickly use that weapon again. The Panchalas are stationed again, desiring victory.’ O venerable one! Having been thus addressed by your son, Ashvatthama sighed in great distress and spoke to the king. ‘O king! This weapon cannot be brought back.<a id="calibre_link-64" href="#calibre_link-1940" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">60</sup></a> It cannot be used a second time. If brought back, there is no doubt that it will kill the person who uses it. O lord of men! Vasudeva devised the means for repulsing the weapon. Otherwise, it would have slain the enemy in the battle. There can be defeat or death. But death is superior to defeat. Having been defeated and forced to cast aside their<a id="calibre_link-65" href="#calibre_link-1941" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">61</sup></a> weapons, they are as good as dead.’ Duryodhana replied, ‘O son of the preceptor! O one who is supreme in the knowledge of weapons! If that weapon cannot be invoked a second time, let the slayers of the preceptor be killed with some other weapon. All the divine weapons are vested in you, just as weapons are vested in Tryambaka.<a id="calibre_link-66" href="#calibre_link-1942" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">62</sup></a> If you so wish, even an enraged Purandara cannot escape from you.’”</p>

That bull among men struck that bull among men<a id="calibre_link-68" href="#calibre_link-1944" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">64</sup></a> with twenty kshudraka arrows and then powerfully pierced him with another five. O king! Dhrishtadyumna was like a powerful fire. O king! He pierced Drona’s son with sixty-three arrows. He used twenty gold-tufted arrows sharpened on stone to pierce his charioteer and pierced his four horses with four sharp arrows. Having been pierced and pierced again, Drona’s son made the earth tremble with his roars, as if he was going to rob all beings of their lives in that great battle. O king! Parshata was powerful, skilled in the use of weapons and firm in his resolution. Deciding on death rather than retreat, he attacked Drona’s son. Panchala, supreme among rathas and possessing an immeasurable soul, showered down arrows on the head of Drona’s son. Enraged in that battle, Drona’s son enveloped him with arrows. Remembering the death of his father, he pierced him with ten arrows. He used a couple of well-aimed and razor-sharp arrows to sever his standard and his bow. Then, Drona’s son struck the prince of Panchala with other arrows. In that great battle, Drona’s son deprived him of his horses, charioteer and chariot. He angrily shrouded all his followers with arrows. O lord of the earth! At this, the Panchala soldiers began to flee. They were frightened, distressed and wounded by those arrows.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3729">‘“On seeing that the warriors were retreating and that Dhrishtadyumna was afflicted, Shini’s descendant quickly urged his chariot towards the chariot of Drona’s son. He struck Ashvatthama with eight sharp arrows. He again struck him violently with twenty arrows that had many different forms. He pierced his charioteer and struck his four horses with four arrows. The great archer was thus violently struck by arrows of many different forms. However, Drona’s son laughed and spoke these words to Yuyudhana. ‘O Shini’s descendant! I know your preference for the slayer of the preceptor.<a id="calibre_link-69" href="#calibre_link-1945" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">65</sup></a> But when he has been grasped by me, you will not be able to save <a id="calibre_link-3730" class="calibre2"></a>him.’ Having spoken these words, Drona’s son released a supreme arrow with excellent tufts. It was as radiant as the sun and it was just as Hari had released his vajra towards Vritra.<a id="calibre_link-70" href="#calibre_link-1946" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">66</sup></a> That arrow pierced his armour and having passed through it, penetrated the ground, like a hissing snake entering a hole. With his armour shattered, the brave one was like an elephant struck by a goad. Copious quantities of blood flowed from his wounds and he let go of his bow and arrows. He was senseless and covered with blood. He sank down on the floor of his chariot. On seeing this, his charioteer swiftly bore him away, away from the chariot of Drona’s son.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-3731">‘“With another well-tufted arrow with drooping tufts, the scorcher of enemies<a id="calibre_link-71" href="#calibre_link-1947" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">67</sup></a> struck Dhrishtadyumna between the eyebrows. He had already been struck and was severely pierced again. Panchala was weak and grabbed the pole of his standard. O king! He was like a crazy elephant, assailed by a lion. On seeing this, five brave Pandava rathas quickly advanced&mdash;Kiriti, Bhimasena, the Pourava Vriddhakshatra,<a id="calibre_link-72" href="#calibre_link-1948" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">68</sup></a> the prince of the Chedis and Sudarshana from Malava. Each of the five simultaneously struck him with five arrows. However, Drona’s son shot twenty-five arrows and simultaneously severed the five arrows, which were like venomous serpents, that each of the five had released. Drona’s son struck Pourava with seven sharp arrows, Malava with three, Partha<a id="calibre_link-73" href="#calibre_link-1949" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">69</sup></a> with one and Vrikodara with six. O king! All of those maharathas pierced Drona’s son. Together, and separately, they used gold-tufted arrows that had been sharpened on stone. The prince pierced Drona’s son with twenty arrows, Partha with eight and each of the others with three arrows. Drona’s son struck Arjuna with six arrows, Vasudeva with ten and Bhima with ten. He struck the prince with four arrows and used two more to sever his bow and his standard. Piercing Partha again with a shower of arrows, Drona’s son roared fiercely, like a lion. Drona’s son used <a id="calibre_link-3732" class="calibre2"></a>extremely sharp and yellow arrows in torrents and covered the front and the rear. The earth, the sky, the firmament, the directions and the sub-directions were covered with these arrows, which were terrible in form. He was fierce in his energy. He was like Indra in his valour. With three arrows that were released at the same time, he severed the head and the two arms, which were like Indra’s standard, of Sudarshana, who was stationed on his own chariot. He killed Pourava with a spear<a id="calibre_link-74" href="#calibre_link-1950" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">70</sup></a> and used his arrows to shatter his chariot into fragments. With broad-headed arrows, he severed his<a id="calibre_link-75" href="#calibre_link-1951" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">71</sup></a> arms, which were smeared with excellent sandalwood paste, and his head from his body. The youthful and beloved prince of Chedi was like the blue lotus<a id="calibre_link-76" href="#calibre_link-1952" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">72</sup></a> in complexion. Using supreme arrows that were like blazing flames of fire, he<a id="calibre_link-77" href="#calibre_link-1953" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">73</sup></a> laughed and pierced him, dispatching him, with his horses and his charioteer, towards death. Having slain those two brave warriors in the battle, the lord who was Drona’s son remained unvanquished and delightedly blew on his large conch shell. All the Panchalas and Pandava Bhimasena were frightened. They abandoned Dhrishtadyumna’s chariot and fled in different directions. When they were running away in this way, Drona’s son pursued them and showered down arrows from the rear. He attacked them with great force and was like Death amidst the Pandu soldiers. In that battle, those kshatriyas were slaughtered by Drona’s son. O king! Terrified of Drona’s son, they fled in all the directions.”’</p>

It was Vibhatsu alone, supported by the Somakas, the Matsyas and some others, who returned against the advancing Kouravas. Savyasachi quickly approached the great archer, who bore the mark of the lion’s tail on his banner. He spoke to Ashvatthama. ‘Show me your strength, your valour, your knowledge, your manliness, the affection that you bear towards the sons of Dhritarashtra, the hatred you bear towards us and the great and supreme energy you possess. Parshata, Drona’s killer, will shatter your insolence today. He is like the fire of destruction and slaughters his enemies in a battle. Clash against him, or against me and Keshava.’”</p>

He also remembered the heart-rending words Yudhishthira had addressed towards him and their hardships and felt miserable in his mind. It was because of this internal fire that he used indecent and unpleasant words towards Drona’s son. The preceptor’s son deserved honour and should not have been addressed in such harsh words, deserving of a coward. O king! Having been thus addressed by Partha in harsh words that struck at the inner chords, the supreme of great archers sighed in rage.

The preceptor’s son directed this at the masses of enemies, whether they were visible or invisible. He used mantras to invoke that weapon on a flaming arrow that was like a fire without smoke. The destroyer of enemy heroes was overcome with rage and released it in all the directions. At this, a tumultuous shower of arrows was generated from the sky. Cold winds began to blow and the sun ceased to radiate heat. Vultures shrieked hideously in all the directions. With a great roar, blood showered down from the sky. Birds, animals, cattle and even sages who were rigid in their vows and supremely careful in controlling their souls, lost all sense of peace. All the great elements were agitated and the sun was dislodged from its course. The three worlds were tormented, feverish and distressed. Tormented by the energy of that arrow, elephants lay down on the ground. Desiring to free themselves from that fierce energy, they sighed deeply. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! The waterbodies were scorched and beings that lived in the water were burnt and could find no peace. Arrows showered down from the sky, the directions and the sub-directions. They descended on the high and the low, with the force of Garuda or that of the wind. The enemies were burnt and fell down, like trees scorched by a fire. Giant elephants were burnt and fell down in every direction, shrieking in woe. Their loud lamentation was like the thunder of the clouds. Other giant elephants were burnt and fled. There were others that were terrified, as if when a forest is burnt and enveloped by a fierce fire. O venerable one! O lord! Large numbers of horses and large numbers of chariots were seen to be burnt and looked like the tops of trees consumed in a conflagration. Large numbers of chariots fell down here and there, in thousands. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! In that battle, it was as if those soldiers were being burnt by the illustrious Agni.

On seeing that they were uninjured, those on the side of the Parthas were delighted and cheerfully blew on supreme conch shells. Those on your side were distressed. On seeing that those great-souled ones had been freed, Drona’s son was extremely miserable. O venerable one! He reflected for a short while about what should be done. O Indra among kings! Having thought for some time, he was overcome with sorrow. He released deep and warm sighs and was distracted. Drona’s son cast aside his bow and descended violently from his chariot.

The mountains were shattered and the elephants in charge of the directions were confused. The world was blind because of darkness and the light could not be seen. The radiance of the sun and all the stellar bodies was destroyed. The rishis were frightened and sought peace and happiness for themselves, as well as for all beings. They performed auspicious rites. Shankara laughed and advancing towards Pusha, who was then eating the sacrificial cake, he uprooted his teeth. At this, the gods trembled and fled. They bowed down before him. He again affixed and aimed a flaming arrow towards the gods and they decided that they would assign a special share for Rudra in sacrifices. O king! In fright, the thirty gods sought refuge with him. Once his anger had been pacified, he restored the sacrifice again. Because of that, the gods are afraid of him, even now. In ancient times, the brave asuras had three cities in the sky. They were large and splendid. One was made out of iron, another out of silver, and the last out of gold. The iron one belonged to Tarakaksha, the silver to Kamalaksha and the splendid golden one to Vidyunmali. With all his weapons, Maghavan was incapable of penetrating them. Oppressed, all the immortals then went to Rudra and sought refuge with him. All those great-souled gods, together with Vasava, said, “O Rudra! The animals fiercely slaughtered in all the rites will belong to you. O lord of the universe! Therefore, bring down these asuras.” Having been thus addressed and with the welfare of the gods in mind, he remained immobile <a id="calibre_link-3761" class="calibre2"></a>for a thousand years.<a id="calibre_link-116" href="#calibre_link-1992" class="calibre2"><sup class="ebsup">112</sup></a> When the three cities came together in the sky, he shattered them with an arrow that had three barbs and three joints.

<h2 class="eb04mainhead" id="calibre_link-5000">Acknowledgements</h2>
<p class="eb02bodytextfullout" id="calibre_link-5001"><span class="dropcaps">C</span>arving time out from one’s regular schedule and work engagements to embark on such a mammoth work of translation has been difficult. It has been a journey of six years, ten volumes and something like 2.25 million words. Sometimes, I wish I had been born in nineteenth-century Bengal, with a benefactor funding me for doing nothing but this. But alas, the days of gentlemen of leisure are long over. The time could not be carved out from professional engagements, barring of course assorted television channels, who must have wondered why I have been so reluctant to head for their studios in the evenings. It was ascribed to health, interpreted as adverse health. It was certainly health, but not in an adverse sense. Reading the Mahabharata is good for one’s mental health and is an activity to be recommended, without any statutory warnings. When I embarked on the hazardous journey, a friend, an author interested in Sanskrit and the Mahabharata, sent me an email. She asked me to be careful, since the track record of those who embarked on unabridged translations of the Mahabharata hasn’t always been desirable. Thankfully, I survived, to finish telling the tale.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-5002">The time was stolen in the evenings and over weekends. The cost was therefore borne by one’s immediate family, and to a lesser extent by friends. Socializing was reduced, since every dinner meant one less chapter done. The family has first claim on the debt, though I am sure it also has claim on whatever merits are due. At least my wife, Suparna Banerjee (Debroy) does, and these volumes are therefore dedicated to her. For six long years, she has walked this path of dharma along with me, providing the conducive home cum family environment that made undistracted work possible. I suspect Sirius has no claim on the merits, though he has been remarkably patient at the times when he has been curled up near my feet and I have been translating away. There is some allegory there about a dog keeping company when the Mahabharata is being read and translated.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-5003">Most people have thought I was mad, even if they never quite said that. Among those who believed and thought it was worthwhile, beyond immediate family, are M. Veerappa Moily, Pratap Bhanu Mehta and Laveesh Bhandari. And my sons, Nihshanka and Vidroha. The various reviewers of different volumes have also been extremely kind and many readers have communicated kind words through email and Twitter, enquiring about progress.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-5004">Penguin also believed. My initial hesitation about being able to deliver was brushed aside by R. Sivapriya, who pushed me after the series had been commissioned by V. Karthika. And then Sumitra Srinivasan became the editor, followed by Paloma Dutta. The enthusiasm of these ladies was so infectious that everything just snowballed and Paloma ensured that the final product of the volumes was much more readable than what I had initially produced.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-5005">When I first embarked on what was also a personal voyage of sorts, the end was never in sight and seemed to stretch to infinity. There were moments of self-doubt and frustration. Now that it is all done, it leaves a vacuum, a hole. That’s not simply because you haven’t figured out what the new project is. It is also because characters who have been part of your life for several years are dead and gone. I don’t mean the ones who died in the course of the actual war, but the others. Most of them faced rather tragic and unenviable ends. Along that personal voyage, the Mahabharata changes you, or so my wife tells me. I am no longer the person I was when I started it, as an individual. That sounds cryptic, deliberately so. Anyone who reads the Mahabharata carefully is bound to change, discount the temporary and place a premium on the permanent.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-5006">To all those who have been part of that journey, including the readers, thank you.</p>
<p class="eb03bodytextindented" id="calibre_link-5007">The original ten volumes were published sequentially, as they were completed, between 2010 and 2014.</p>
